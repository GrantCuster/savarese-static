			<p>I set out today on the 4th of July to paint my bathroom, and ended up sitting in my kitchen sobbing while listening to the show about DJ on Diane Rehm. I was so moved by DJ&#8217;s story and by Ralph&#8217;s telling of it. I am the mother of two great kids, ages 12 and 11, and I have felt both moved and directionless in what feels to be a calling to help children less fortunate than my own. DJ&#8217;s story inspired me to commit myself to moving forward in determining what that calling is, rather than waiting for some voice in my head (divine or otherwise) to tell me what it is. I am buying the book and will hit myself over the head with it if the reading of it isn&#8217;t sufficient inspiration. So I wanted to say thank you.</p>

			<p>I found the article in this morning&#8217;s Des Moines Register to be of great interest. I will order your book today and read it before asking questions about how you have managed to work with your local school system.</p>
<p>I am an attorney practicing generally, but in substantial part, in the area of special education law. You may be aware of an ongoing special education legal matter in which school personnel were physically restraining an eight-year old girl with autism, and confining her for long periods of time in a school storage closet. Another attorney and I represent the girl and her parents in this mind-bending matter. While we won her due process hearing on all of the 14 points set forth in the action, the school district and AEA are appealing the decision.</p>
<p>As the parent as an adult child who does not have autism but who is decidedly neuroatypical, and as the former coordinator of services of students with learning disabilities at The University of Iowa for 12 years before entering law school, I sense that you share the passion that Curt and I have long-possessed for affirming the lives of children with disabilities.</p>
<p>I will look forward to reading your book, and wish the best to you, Emily and DJ.</p>

			<p>We read the article in the DSM Register today and went on to view your website. We live in Iowa and have 3 biological sons, the 2 youngest have Autism. Justin is 7 and is non-verbal and still wears diapers. He is slowly learning to communicate by typing and your son reminds us much of our son. We have every hope that he will some day be able to communicate with us in the way that D.J. is able. Our youngest son, Tyler, is 6 and is able to communicate verbally and we were able to get him out of diapers at age 4 years and 10 months. He did not speak a word until he was 3, but it came to him at age 3 and he has never stopped talking since! We are so grateful that Tyler is progressing, but it is very bittersweet to see him surpass Justin in these areas. I fear every day that an illness or accident will befall me or my husband and Justin will end up in a foster home such as D.J. did. I worry every day that someone will treat Justin the way that D.J. was treated as a young boy. I am so glad you were able to bring DJ into your family and make him feel so secure. We work so hard to help Justin and we love him so much, it breaks our hearts that he cannot communicate effectively, but DJ&#8217;s story has given us more hope than ever for Justin. Thank you for sharing DJ&#8217;s struggles and successes with your article, website and book.</p>

			<p>My sister sent me a copy of your (and DJ&#8217;s) book Reasonable People, and I have just finished reading the introduction. My daughter, an 11-year-old non-speaking, un-house-trained &#8220;classical&#8221; autist, has been using FC since she was 5, shortly after it was discovered that she had independently taught herself to read. Your arguments and conclusions in the book&#8217;s introduction resonate both in the general and, in many cases, with the specific.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the case of the multi-lingual autist who could be &#8216;tested&#8217; by using non-speakers of the language in use as facilitators, proving the truth of FC. In our case, my daughter has a number of facilitators, but her &#8216;voice&#8217; resolutely remains hers: her fascination with and love of language and the particulars of her phrasing remain consistent, regardless of who is holding her wrist.</p>
<p>Her ability to communicate abstract thought and her considerable emotional &#8216;literacy&#8217; has, for us, led to a total distrust of autistic stereotypes as promulgated by the scientific community (Wing et al). An example: I suffer from intermittent depression. One day she typed that she found me, in her words, &#8220;hard to read. I&#8217;m never sure whether you are up or down.&#8221; This immediately tells me two things: that she is concerned about who and how I am and is attempting to empathize, difficult as that may be (that difficulty stemming from who I am, rather than who she is), and that conversely she is able to &#8220;read&#8221; other people.</p>
<p>Like DJ, she often expresses a wish to help, indeed campaign for, autistic people. As an old-school lefty I thoroughly enjoy their instinctive radicalism!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll conclude by transcribing a poem she wrote when she was six (her spelling and punctuation).</p>
<blockquote><p>BEACH TIME<br />
There beauty lies beneath.<br />
Magical bounty topping the bouncy waves.<br />
Misty, utterly glimmering haze bites my eyes.<br />
Here moments are glittery dreams. </p></blockquote>

			<p>Hello, Ralph, and well met!</p>
<p>I just returned from the &#8220;Boys and the Boy Crisis&#8221; conference in D.C. with a deeper understanding of how much we all need work like yours. As the father of a special needs child who was harassed, derided and put off by the system while getting him the help he needed, I of course felt an immediate kinship with you and your work. Your eloquence, and that of your son, is truly historical in nature because you have CHOSEN to make it so.</p>
<p>To illustrate this; there was much conversation about boy/girl academic achievement and the resistance to all-boy classrooms by organized feminist groups. When I pointed out before a panel of opinion leaders that &#8220;we already have single-sex classrooms; we call them &#8216;special-ed&#8217;&#8221;, it was an aha moment.</p>
<p>I would love to interview you at some point in the near future. </p>

<p>I have never read words so startlingly similar to my own son&#8217;s typed sentences than those of DJ in your wonderful book.</p>
<p>It is a marvel, expounding on so many points that I so sparsely tried to offer in my own small book this year. While I sang about the mountain, you climbed every inch of it! I would love to send you my book-cd, songs and stories inspired by my son, David, who is 21, and has experienced his own share of hell at the hands of the system.</p>

			<p>I was touched to my core on hearing you, Ralph James Savarese, on public radio a few days ago. Please tell D. J. that he is truly a most remarkable young man from whom all of us can learn. I will share your website with a number of people, and hope to buy the book even though at this point, fortunately, our family has not been directly touched by autism. We are all touched, however, by your courageous story, D. J. and by your courageous and persistent parents who have invested their lives because they believe in and care for you.</p>

			<p>Mr. Savarese,</p>
<p>Enjoyed hearing you speak on the Diane Rhem show. Your encouraging and insightful comments about autism were right on track. With encouragement and love all things are possible no matter who the child is.</p>
<p>My son was diagnosed in high school with Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome. Prior to this, he was seen as retarded or borderline. He was misunderstood for years. We kept searching for answers and when the diagnosis came, it made sense.</p>
<p>Fortunately along the way, we discovered what worked for my son. We tried learning programs like Kuman and Sylvan but the &#8220;group&#8221; dynamics of these tutoring programs did not work well for him. Old fashion one-to-one tutoring worked best for him.</p>
<p>High School proved to be difficult because of the social scene. This also had a negative impact on his academics. Fortunately he survived the high school experience.</p>
<p>Today he drives, works part time and attends the Northern Virginia Community College. He plans to attend George Mason University and wants to be a writer. You were correct in your discussion with Diane that there is no limit to what people can do unless we limit them ourselves!</p>

			<p>I heard your story on the Diane Ream show this morning. Thank you for sharing your story! Please continue to speak out about the importance of acceptance and inclusion as you so eloquently did this morning. I was particularly touched by DJ&#8217;s chapter and the letter he wrote to the special school in Florida.</p>
<p>As a special educator who believes in inclusive education (done right!) I have seen great progress in children who were considered &#8220;unteachable&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know that we all have a big challenge in convincing our education systems, politicians, and the general public in the rights to a quality education for all children. An education that is truly individualized to meet their unique needs in the everyday world, not a segregated world.</p>

			<p>Dear Dr. Savarese,</p>
<p>Thank you for your article in the LA Times Your Adopting Who? My husband and I are currently in the process of adopting 3 (amazing, gorgeous, adorable, talented, hilarious, intelligent, loving&#8230;) &#8220;special needs&#8221; sisters out of foster care. I don&#8217;t know which is more disconcerting &#8212; the family freak-out (do you know how difficult those children can be?) or the beatifying friend (God has a special place for people like you). Lots of people want kids. It&#8217;s not a public service. And, our three girls, with their laundry list of reported behavioral issues, behave like angels for us. We&#8217;re nothing special, all they needed was a modicum of love and stability &#8212; a chance. And they&#8217;ve brought more love and laughter (becoming a mom has made me a bit mushy) into our lives than we could have imagined. So why does everyone act like they should be grateful to us?</p>
<p>Glad to hear I&#8217;m not the only annoyed adoptive parent.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

			<p>Dear Ralph Savarese:</p>
<p>I want to congratulate you for your splendid book, but I really especially want to say that the last chapter, by DJ, is among the most beautiful texts I&#8217;ve read, and I fancy myself a great reader (I&#8217;m also a writer, have written two books). Your son says he intends to be a writer: I fervently hope he will sustain that hope at least long enough to write a book, because I expect he will write a masterpiece. I was in tears, reading his sentences, not so much for what they said as for how they are composed. It&#8217;s the most extraordinary writing; it makes Gertrude Stein seem old-fashioned (and it&#8217;s about time someone did that). There is just nothing else remotely like it, and I hope you&#8217;ll pass along to DJ my sincere best wishes and thanks. You and Emily have clearly been superb parents. I myself once had the privilege of knowing a young boy with autism, and though brief, the experience (for about a year, while I worked in the Upstate Home for Children, in New York State, a dismal institution) is among my happiest of all memories. I recall one morning waiting for Chris&#8217;s classes to begin, I had him on my lap and was reading to him, and he seemed to be following along and caring about the book and ever so slightly about me, and nothing has ever made me happier. My boyfriend and I are interested in adopting&#8211;we&#8217;ve been very frustrated so far&#8211;but your book will certainly give us something to think about. I didn&#8217;t think we were up to caring for an Autist; now I feel a bit more like we may be.</p>
<p>With very best wishes—</p>
