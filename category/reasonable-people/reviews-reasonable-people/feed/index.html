			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ralph Savarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> is a heart-wrenching memoir of autistic abuse, abandonment, adoption and durable love. Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa, writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.</p>
<p>Emily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.</p>
<p>As the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:</p>
<p>“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”</p>
<p>It pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:</p>
<p>“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,</p>
<p>“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”</p>
<p>As DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”</p>
<p>Savarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”</p>
<p>There may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,</p>
<p>‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”</p>
<p>Ralph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.</p>
<p>“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”</p>
<p>In Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.</p>
<p>For all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.</p>
<p>The last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:</p>
<p>“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations. This is, however, a story about what life is all about: trial, error, perseverance, and faith in people. Faith in love. Ralph, Emily and DJ give us that, and much more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Autism, which has burst into public consciousness in the last few years, is known as a spectrum condition, in which people exhibit autistic behavior along a scale from high functioning to low functioning. Writer Ralph James Savarese, the adoptive father of 12-year-old DJ, is the latest to pen a saga of what it&#8217;s like to live with autism.</p>
<p>One keen insight Savarese brings to the table is that autism is universally perceived with reference to average human beings as the norm. To the extent that an autist&#8217;s behavior deviates from that norm, we treat it as a disease to be cured. Within the growing autism community, however, a movement is growing to portray it as a way of life rather than as a disease to be cured.</p>
<p>Consider my six-year-old grandson Toby, for example. He was diagnosed autistic four years ago, and intensive one-on-one therapy since then has allowed him to speak fluently, to relate to others to some degree, and to function in a mainstream first-grade classroom, albeit with the presence of aides. His perseverative behavior &#8212; hand-flapping  and obsessively repetitive behavior, for example &#8212; has lessened markedly. But his parents realize that Toby will likely need supportive help of some kind for the rest of his life, even though a realistic expectation is that he&#8217;ll be able to live independently as an adult.</p>
<p>But like many high-functioning autists, Toby exhibits strong signs of Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome &#8212; a savant quality that enables him to run rings around kids his own age in certain specific areas. He&#8217;s long been fascinated with maps and regularly studies the schematic route maps of the MBTA system in his hometown of Boston. He can direct a driver, street by street, from his home to that of his grandparents in Hartford, something his highly talented 10 year old cousin would be at a loss to do. The point of all this is that we can learn from and value people with autism for their own impressive gifts.</p>
<p>When the author adopted DJ at age 6, he was entirely non-verbal and seemed unable to communicate. Six years later, he still doesn&#8217;t speak but types fluently, aspires to become a writer, and even wrote the last chapter of the book. While parts of that chapter can be difficult to understand &#8212; Toby edited it himself &#8212; it provides a wonderful window into his mind. He has a profound distaste for testing, for example, and characteristic of autistic people, he seems to have made that distaste a somewhat obsessive fixation.</p>
<p>One highly useful construct Savarese employs is to compare DJ&#8217;s situation with that of the genius Stephen Hawking, who though non-verbal because he has Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease, has learned to type on a computer by moving his eyes.  So basically, Hawking and DJ started from the common condition of having something to say but needing help to get it out. Savarese&#8217;s book is an inspiration, and his son DJ is a boy to watch in the years ahead.</p>

all night . . .</p>
<p>when I stayed up reading Ralph James Savarese&#8217;s A-list account of his adoption of DJ, a six-year-old boy abandoned by his birth parents because of his classic autism and their own emotional impairments, then cast adrift in the rough, unforgiving seas of the American foster care system.</p>
<p>At four in the morning, just shy of three-quarters of the way through the 400-plus-page account, I reached a point that I sometimes encounter in reading — I wanted to finish, get to the end, know what would happen next, and I didn&#8217;t want to finish, get to the end, and not be able to stay wrapped inside this astounding narrative where the boundaries between parenting, activism, and advocacy are fluid if not seamless, an account that certainly complicates some of the recent discussions of the role of parents in the autistic rights movement.</p>
<p>First, for those who&#8217;ve not yet picked up their own copy of Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption (and I urge you to do so right now), a brief plot summary (spoiler alert: skip this paragraph and the next if you don&#8217;t want to have the narrative trajectory derailed): Savarese and his wife Emily, an autism inclusion advocate and expert, met DJ through her work. DJ had been abandoned by his birth father, and neglected and abused by his alcoholic birth mother. He&#8217;d been sodomized and further abused in an overcrowded fostercare home where an adolescent boy, also a victim of sexual abuse, had tried to work through his own trauma by violating the then-speechless-thus-perfect-victim, DJ,</p>
<p>The story retraces the Savareses&#8217; journey through the twisted legal terrain of fostercare adoption, and into the pioneering territory of full-inclusion for DJ in a public school, in the least-restrictive educational setting, the contested terrain of facilitated communication, and the heartwrenching reunions of DJ and his birth sister — the child who had taken care of her little brother when addiction had rendered their birth mother incapable of mother-work. Through uncompromising love and commitment to DJ and his personhood, the Savareses create a home that is safe enough for DJ to reveal — in his own typed messages — the magnitude of the abuse he&#8217;d suffered in fostercare. I did skip ahead to read the last chapter, written by DJ himself, so I know that there is an amazing conclusion, if not a saccharin-laced smiley-faced happy ending.</p>
<p>While there is much to love in this book and this family (pictured here), and much to discuss about it, what appeals so profoundly to me in the story is Savarese&#8217;s unwillingness to throw out the baby with the bathwater, whether that baby is his son, a commitment to inclusion and the principle of the least restrictive setting, or the emancipatory possibilities of psychoanalysis — a theory that has a well-deserved bad reputation in the autism world, saddled as it has been with the legacy of mother-blaming encapsulated in Bettelheim&#8217;s &#8220;refrigerator mother&#8221; hypothesis.</p>
<p>I have been grappling with this very theoretical issue in my own more work, wondering what to do with psychoanalysis, and wondering what atypical language acquistion means for the development of structures like the unconscious and desire. Like Savarese, I came of age intellectually in the cultural studies milieu of the late 1980s and 90s and was steeped in a heady brew of psychoanalytic theory, dialectical materialism, and feminism.</p>
<p>Autism parenting has challenged each of these frameworks, but none more aggressively than psychoanalytic theory. I&#8217;d backburnered my questions about this until recently, when my psychoanalytic reading group had asked me to present a paper about autism and psychoanalysis at a regional conference in February. I had agreed, and then, still conflicted about the role of psychoanalysis in autism&#8217;s misrepresentation, I was sick the weekend of the conference and wound up not going. Conflict can do that to any body.</p>
<p>Savarese&#8217;s narrative, healing for himself and his family, has been similarly healing for me. With an easier integration of my lived experience and theoretical models, I hope to be able to present that paper this summer at a national conference — thanks to Savarese and his intellectual and emotional integrity.</p>
<p>And more on Reasonable People in the days to come . . . 100 or so enveloping pages to go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a long time, I refused to buy any books with the dreaded &#8220;A&#8221; word in the title (that pesky magical thinking again). Somehow the idea of having them in the house made our suspicions, and then the emerging reality, seem more intense. But the ice had to melt, and eventually I broke down and bought Greenspan&#8217;s <em>The Child With Special Needs</em>, and then <em>The Out-Of-Sync Child</em>, desperately trying to understand how our son was like the children described in those books. But he wasn&#8217;t, really, not in any clear-cut way, and the whole idea that he might be &#8220;on the spectrum&#8221; filled us with equal parts dread and confusion.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t stop me from sidling over to the children&#8217;s section in the bookstore from time to time, then furtively paging through <em>Quirky Kids</em> and <em>The Maverick Mind</em> and countless others to see if any struck a chord. But I&#8217;d always leave the store empty-handed and a little shaken. Is this really us? Am I missing something? The first memoir I read was Paul Collins&#8217; <em>Not Even Wrong</em> (love him; reading <em>Sixpence House</em> now, which is about reading, not autism), and then Kamran Nazeer&#8217;s <em>Send in the Idiots</em>, and then one day, in an effort to find a bit of serenity, Susan Senator&#8217;s <em>Making Peace with Autism</em>. Around that time, J. and I started to ease up on the whole is-he-or-isn&#8217;t-he debate, and accept that a) if there is a spectrum, he&#8217;s on it; b) this is, in J&#8217;s words, &#8220;current events, not prophecy&#8221; and c) none of this changes who my son is: a smart, delightful, funny, loving boy.</p>
<p>What were we resisting? That he was different from other children? No, that was pretty clear. That he has difficulties with speech, and motor planning, and sensory integration, and social situations? No, we got that. That we needed to give him as much therapy as we could reasonably fit into his life&#8211;and ours? No, he had a full program of therapies by the time he was two and a half. That we should limit our expectations? That he might never be independent? That he didn&#8217;t have empathy? That we should just accept all the received wisdom about what a child with autism spectrum disorder can do and will become? That our life as we knew it was over? No. No. No. No. No. We didn&#8217;t, and don&#8217;t, accept any of that. He&#8217;s given us no reason to; in fact, he&#8217;s full of surprises.</p>
<p>So I was delighted to find a link to Ralph Savarese&#8217;s LA Times editorial on Mom-NOS&#8217;s blog a couple of weeks ago (thanks, Mom!), in which he espouses a joyful, optimistic and, I believe, respectful model for parenting a child with special needs. I was even more delighted to read his book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism &#038; Adoption</em> this past week. Let me say this upfront: it is not a book to pick up lightly. It&#8217;s about intense commitment: commitment to a child with autism whose biological parents were unable or unwilling to care for him, who had suffered extreme neglect and abuse, who did not speak, and who, with the aid of his adoptive parents&#8217; incredible love and persistence and ingenuity and patience, learns to communicate independently, reflect on his past, participate and excel in school and give us a glimpse&#8211;more than a glimpse&#8211;into what autism feels like from the inside.</p>
<p>Heroic? Heartwarming? A triumph of the human spirit? I would say yes, actually, but that&#8217;s not at all what Savarese is after. Like any thoughtful memoirist, he resists the narcissism inherent in the form, and it gnaws at him throughout the book. He doesn&#8217;t want to be praised or idealized. He&#8217;s not looking for the easy out. He insists meticulously on detailing his own doubts, faults, frailties through the process of bonding with, adopting and raising his son DJ. He doesn&#8217;t shy from political, cultural, psychological, even literary analysis of autism and disability. He wants us to see it all: the anguish, the confusion, the joys, the mistakes, the odd trajectories of progress and regression.</p>
<p>Most stunning about this book is that, through the process of facilitated communication (in which he types his thoughts with some slight physical assistance from his parents), DJ becomes able to express himself and thus tell his own story. Savarese includes many of DJ&#8217;s thoughts, poems and school assignments throughout the book, up to and including the final chapter, which is DJ&#8217;s work entirely (I did find myself wishing that his wife had had a chapter too). I won&#8217;t go into the whole facilitated communication debate here (Savarese covers that in great detail), but I was touched to hear this lovely boy&#8217;s voice as he wrestled with the circumstances of his life and of his own identity, finally coming to a kind of peace. In DJ&#8217;s words, &#8220;Breathing feels great now. Breathing feels kind of like joy.&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Savarese, a writer and professor at Grinnell College, writes a moving account of his family&#8217;s adoption of DJ, an abused, autistic youngster. Throughout, he describes the process of helping DJ communicate with the world and discusses larger issues of the rights of people with neurological differences. Savarese&#8217;s wife, an autism professional, first encountered DJ when he was only two and a half; by the time they could adopt him, three years later, he&#8217;d lived in several homes and been badly abused in foster care. Because he didn&#8217;t speak, people were unaware of what he&#8217;d suffered; some doubted he even could suffer, believing the myth that the autistic have no sense of self or others. As the Savareses worked with their son, teaching him to sign and to use &#8220;facilitated communication&#8221; with a keyboard, they learned more about his very deep thoughts and feelings. As they fought to include him in mainstream classrooms, they also struggled with his emerging demons: his memories of abuse, his pain from parental abandonment. Savarese writes with passion and humor, careful to include extensive excerpts from DJ&#8217;s typing, so readers get a sense of his remarkable growth.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A black hole.</p>
<p>That is the image that Ralph Savarese opens his forthcoming book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> with. He writes:</p>
<p>To many experts, the non-speaking Autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.</p>
<p>To be autistic and to be non-verbal was once, Savarese suggests, to be a kind of human black hole, a bottomless, empty, mysterious nothingness that took in information and stimuli and never did anything it. And this is, I suspect and I know, how my son, Charlie, would have been regarded had he been born fifty years ago, forty, twenty; and this is how DJ, Savarese’s adopted autistic son, might still be regarded had he not been taught to type the words inside of him.</p>
<p>Savarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> tells many stories: How DJ came into his parents-to-be’s lives in Florida; how DJ suffered in the “care” of a foster parent; how Savarese becomes a father; how 9-year-old DJ, after several years of hand-over-hand typing, emerges into “full-blown communication.” DJ is now a straight-A honor roll student in middle school in a town in south-central Iowa. And DJ wrote the final chapter (”It’s My Story”) of Savarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em>. Just because a child—an autistic child—cannot speak, cannot express himself orally—-does not mean that he cannot speak, as this book by Savarese and by DJ shows. The black hole is not so bleak, not so silent, after all. </p>
<p>Savarese, who teaches American literature and creative writing at Grinnell College, begins Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption by describing the new version of the black hole: Rather than swallowing up all particles, all information, forever, black holes are now said to allow information to escape. Savarese quotes no less an expert on these matters than physicist Stephen Hawking—-indeed, he refers to an incident in July of 2004, in which Hawking officially conceded a bet to his Cal-Tech colleague, John Preskill. &#8220;As the headline from the Technology and Science page of the MSNBC website put it, &#8216;Hawking changes his mind on black holes: Galactic traps may actually allow information to escape.&#8217; At the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, Ireland, Hawking presented Preskill with a book: <em>Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia</em>. In doing so, the world’s most famous physicist mocked his own theory with an object from which, in the words of one reporter, “information is easily retrieved.”</p>
<p>Savarese’s <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> is a gripping narrative of how DJ came into his and his wife Emily’s life, of how autism came into his life; of how a child who many “experts” had written off, has himself learned to write and can tell his own story. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been able to find the right words to describe life with my daughter, Natalie. We adopted her five years ago, and she came to us with special needs—ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and various other issues. My mantra—&#8221;she’s easy to love, but hard to raise&#8221;—is inadequate in describing either the intense love and joy or the chaos and exhaustion she’s brought to my life.</p>
<p><em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism &#038; Adoption</em>, by Ralph James Savarese (Other Press; $25.95), states—clearly, concisely, and with passion—why some people adopt. Why some people adopt kids with special needs. Why we adopted Natalie. It’s a powerful, complex book about &#8220;what hope and commitment can accomplish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Savarese, a professor at Grinnell College, and his wife, an expert on autism and inclusion, adopted their son, DJ, from the U.S. foster system when he was six. DJ has autism. He doesn’t speak, and he experienced severe trauma before joining his family. Woven into the story of their adoption journey, the challenges and triumphs they’ve shared along the way, are Savarese’s treatises on the politics of differing abilities, foster care and adoption, and the meaning of family.</p>
<p>It’s an intellectually (morally, ideologically) challenging read. But to say it’s &#8220;worth the challenge&#8221; would imply that I had to slog through it. That’s not true—I could hardly put it down. DJ, who now practices &#8220;facilitated communication,&#8221; using a computer, wrote the final chapter himself. &#8220;I resent these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone,&#8221; he writes. It isn’t easy reading, DJ. It’s life-changing reading.</p>
<p>I e-mailed Savarese, hoping for a quote I could include in my review. Reading it gave me shivers. It will tell you, more clearly than I ever could, why you should read the book.</p>
<p>In the author’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hate the fetish of blood relations. Not only does it make adopted children and families feel like second-class citizens, but it perniciously tells us that our ethical obligations extend no further than our natural (as opposed to artificial) ties. So screw the homeless man on the street or the poor family on the other side of town. So long as I&#8217;m good to my mother, well, then, I&#8217;m a good person. Baloney! We need to open our eyes to the predicaments of those less fortunate; we need to look beyond the walls of the gated community that is often the blood family. More creative family making might actually help us to realize the sentimental trope of the “human family.”</p>
<p>For my wife and me, adoption was a FIRST-resort adventure in responding to the desperate plight of a badly abused, wordless little boy. This boy has given us MORE than we have given him. Has it been exhausting? You bet; the most exhausting and challenging and anxiety-producing thing I have ever done. Ever. But also the most rewarding.</p>
<p>Why are we on this planet? I believe to grow in our capacity to care and attend to human suffering. By stretching ourselves, sometimes beyond measure, we find a joy that approximates wisdom. My wife and I are NOT saints and don&#8217;t appreciate being compared to such beings. Our relationship has suffered. We don&#8217;t have time for the many things we used to do. But whose relationship hasn&#8217;t suffered with the arrival of kids, whether adopted or not? Looking back on the last 10 years, we marvel at what hope and commitment can accomplish.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“My name is DJ and I am taking a trip of a lifetime.”</p>
<p>The line above appears in the journal of DJ Savarese who is the co-author of the memoir <em>Reasonable People</em> which has just been published by The Other Press.  The sub-title of the book is as important to culture as the title itself: “On the meaning of family and the politics of neurological difference”.  This timely book is about the Horatian life, “Life” written with a capital “L”.  Accordingly it is about family and the life of the mind; about poetry and the fierce resistance to stereotypes of people with autism.</p>
<p>Assuredly one can think of dozens of additional sub-titles for the book: Living Outside their Boxes; Unraveling the Outworn Tapestry of Academic Autism; A Prayer Wheel by Two Poets; or The Road of Salt and Honey.   </p>
<p>This is a memoir about “hard traveling” as Woody Guthrie would say, and yet it is far more than a narrative of trouble and triumph.  The poet, Ralph James Savarese, skillfully tells the story of his adoptive son DJ’s former life of physical and intellectual abuse and in turn and almost seamlessly tells the story of how he and his wife Emily must grow both intellectually and emotionally and yes, politically, since DJ’s autism is the kind of disability our culture has misunderstood throughout history.   </p>
<p>Ralph James Savarese is a poet who teaches creative writing and literature at Grinnell College.  With the publication of Reasonable People he joins a group of poets who have written nonfiction accounts of disability that includes Lucy Grealy, Nancy Mairs, Mary Karr, Kenny Fries, Michael Berube, and Audre Lorde just to name a few.  Reasonable People is a landmark book, both in its poetic appreciation of what Carl Jung’s followers call “depth psychology” and for its tough minded counter-statement to a longstanding view that autistic people will, necessarily have limited epistemological options in life.  Such views are the product of neo-Victorian science and they depend on the inability of individuals to resist easy classifications.  Such resistance is, of course, the business of poetry, that “sweat of the heart” as the poet Marvin Bell would call it.</p>
<p>This is a book about “joint attention” as Emily, Ralph, and DJ learn to appreciate the complex interactions between the self and the other, between the moment and what lies just behind us or straight ahead.  The book is about the dark theater of autism and the academy.  It is about the flesh of belief.  Beyond this I will tell you nothing for I dislike book reviews that retell the story.</p>
<p>Although this is a book about poetry and parenting it is perhaps most of all DJ’s own book for it ends with his journal notes and poems.  He is now a young man who speaks for himself and who aims his own telescope at the full moon.  Again, and not wishing to give away too much, let me simply quote one of DJ’s own poems which appears near the end of the book.  It is as fine a definition of poetry and the life of the mind as I have ever seen:</p>
<blockquote><p>HOW BRAVE?<br />
He was so brave that free people<br />
Saluted him every time he passed by.<br />
So brave, if you didn&#8217;t really know him<br />
You&#8217;d think he was a god.<br />
So brave, the tests he took couldn&#8217;t<br />
Scare him.<br />
And so brave, all the dreadful creatures<br />
Died.<br />
That&#8217;s brave!</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading Ralph Savarese&#8217;s <em>Reasonable People</em>, and I can&#8217;t remember the last time I read a book that made me think about so many difficult things all at once. The book is told memoir-style, telling the story of what it has been like thus far for Savarese and his wife, Emily, an autism inclusion expert, to raise their adopted son, DJ. However, though the main tale is that of life with DJ, Savarese uses this as a platform for the discussion of many larger societal issues that affect us all, whether we know someone with autism or not, (though clearly pretty much anyone reading this blog does.)</p>
<p>The first issue, or rather, the first set of issues, he talks about are those of poverty, foster care, and adoption. He discusses in detail his own initial desire to not have children, because doing so would limit his ability to take part in the wider world and would not allow him to devote his time to altruistic causes he believed in. When they first met DJ, he and his wife were devoted to getting DJ and his sister back into their biological mother&#8217;s care. Throughout the narration of their prolonged relationship with Rhonda, in which they helped her both financially and in the court system, Savarese also discusses many of the thoughts he had about the cyclic nature of poverty and his desire to see it truly confronted as a societal problem in which everyone needs to take an interest, because it is everyone&#8217;s responsibility as a whole. He continued this discussion in his description of the foster care system, in which many of the families providing foster care are poor families doing it for the childcare stipend. He notes that this draws an inadvertent, sometimes antagonistic divide, often along class lines, between prospective adoptive families and foster care families. His stark look at the foster care and state adoption systems reveal a need for change, but also a realistic look at how overtaxed the systems are, being a essentially stopgap measure for addressing much larger societal problems.</p>
<p>Once Savarese and his wife succeed in adopting DJ, they are determined to get him into an inclusive educational setting. Up to that point, he had attended a closed center school, in which he had made little progress. Thanks to Emily&#8217;s own inclusion expertise and both of the determination of them both to prevail over the school system, they succeeded, and DJ began on the road to literacy and learning. The arguments presented between Emily and the schools, both the center school and the public elementary school, are classic, and powerful, examples of the argument over inclusion. As one can tell from the chapter at the end of the book, though, DJ is most definitely a proponent of inclusive environments, which he makes clear in a letter addressed to his old preschool teachers.</p>
<p>One of the most important things DJ gains from his new intensive educational experiences is literacy. As it turns out, literacy opens many avenues of communication for DJ, because he says he didn&#8217;t learn to decode spoken language until he learned to read. Their efforts towards literacy also led to an inadvertent discovery of facilitated communication (FC), and Savarese spends some time defending the method in its legitimate form, discussing the controversy that surrounded it in the early &#8217;90s, but presenting powerful evidence of research done since then proving its efficacy when used appropriately. He also mentions numerous successful users of FC, who now lead quite rich lives and are able to advocate for themselves. DJ looks well on the way to becoming one of these vocal, or should we say, typing advocates. Indeed, DJ, as well as his parents, have discovered the world of disability/identity politics, and these play a strong role in their story.</p>
<p>However, one of the things that makes this book so unique amongst the available books on autism, aside from its focus on adoption, is its exploration of the relationship between trauma and autism. DJ was severely physically and sexually abused by another child in foster care, and it was only after he learned to communicate that he seemed able to assimilate and understand this part of his past. This led to many problems with anxiety, anger, confusion, and separation. Dealing with this through therapy was much more complicated when combined with autism and communicating via FC, and Savarese describes many of the issues they and their therapists faced in dealing with something relatively unknown. Many of the standard therapy techniques became problems in and of themselves, as DJ began to perseverate on his past trauma, rather than moving through the memories to the other side. In addition, the more anxious and upset he became, the more violent and less communicative he would become. The combination of trauma, in this case PTSD, and autism is not a field that has been widely explored, and this book can be considered a call for more attention and research. Savarese points out that the nonverbal in our population are far more likely to suffer abuse, and this problem is probably much more widespread than we would like to think.</p>
<p>Though Savarese also writes movingly about the meaning of family, particularly in relation to the bond between DJ and his biological sister; dealing with loss in many forms; the relationship between poetry and DJ&#8217;s unique perceptions of the world; and numerous other things, I fear that I have run on for too long already, so I&#8217;ll simply end here with a recommendation that everyone read this book. Truly, it is a moving, fascinating, and of course remarkably well-written book, and I am sad to have had to condense it this much.</p>
