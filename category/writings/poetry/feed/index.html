			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <em>The Seneca Review</em>, Fall 2011, Vol. 41/2.</p>
<p>Long before he&#8217;d put his trust in antitrust litigation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defending high-profile companies from the charge<br />
of monopolistic behavior, he&#8217;d dreamt of being on the court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there he was, though not exactly in robes,<br />
offering up his considered opinions: &#8220;Out!&#8221; &#8220;Out!&#8221; &#8220;Long!&#8221; &#8220;Long!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was playing Justice Stevens<br />
in the annual Washington Golf and Country Club championships,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 1%er version of a constitutional battle.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://rattle.com/blog/2010/08/nor-yet-a-dream-of-war-by-ralph-james-savarese/"><em>Rattle</em></a> (Winter 2009, #32).  Visit <a href="http://rattle.com/blog/2010/08/nor-yet-a-dream-of-war-by-ralph-james-savarese/"><em>Rattle</em></a> for an audio version of the poem:</p>
<p>We were sixth-graders at middle school camp,<br />
conscripts in an old regime of the masculine,</p>
<p>privates third-class,<br />
dreading the common shower,</p>
<p>the inevitable comparisons—<br />
my own genital region like an unplanted field</p>
<p>far from a forest.<br />
We didn’t much care for our unit,</p>
<p>especially the bigger boys, lords of the rise<br />
they got out of you,</p>
<p>bullies snapping their towels,<br />
giving someone a wedgie.</p>
<p>Two hours into the trip and you were miserable:<br />
a sullen lump on the rope swing.</p>
<p>The second night, after the ghost stories<br />
and guitar, after the game</p>
<p>of capture the flag,<br />
after the Walton family imitations</p>
<p>(“Night, John Boy. Night, Mary Ellen”),<br />
you showed up at my bed—unannounced,</p>
<p>shivering, distraught.<br />
“I’m cold,” you whispered, tapping me</p>
<p>on the shoulder. “I’m cold.”<br />
And I, drowsy with sleep,</p>
<p>thinking you were my baby sister<br />
scared of a thunderstorm,</p>
<p>or not thinking at all, told you<br />
to crawl in.</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>And that’s how, the next morning,<br />
the gym teacher found us:</p>
<p>in the same zipped-up sleeping bag,<br />
the same sweaty, blue cocoon of dreams.</p>
<p>Remember trying to scramble back to consciousness?<br />
Suddenly, a voice loud enough to wake</p>
<p>the other boys:<br />
“WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?”</p>
<p>Like a street urchin flushed from an underground city,<br />
you maneuvered through winding</p>
<p>passageways and inky, muck-filled sewers<br />
to locate a manhole.</p>
<p>Then lifting the cumbersome lid,<br />
you rose into shame—I right behind you.</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>Say we were two boys together clinging<br />
(that’s how Whitman once put it),</p>
<p>two boys wrapped in goose-feather affection,<br />
our skulls propped against one another</p>
<p>like pick-up sticks, sunlight<br />
pouring into the musty cabin, splashing</p>
<p>on the walls—dawn once again at it<br />
with her water canon.</p>
<p>All that muscle-crowned gym teacher<br />
could talk about was sex</p>
<p>and a word (sodomy) we didn’t understand.<br />
His fellow chaperone, the guidance counselor,</p>
<p>insisted on phoning our fathers.<br />
“What they need is a good man-to-man.”</p>
<p>Yours was hysterical—let us say,<br />
representatively so.</p>
<p>Three tears for the moderate Republican<br />
from Maine, that toupee-ed paradox!</p>
<p>He saw the future as a carpet at last unrolled,<br />
a red one ruined by moths.</p>
<p>So much for ever being President…<br />
Mine, the corporate lawyer,</p>
<p>made a motion<br />
to hold me in contempt.</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>Must a boy swim upstream for miles and then<br />
like a salmon agreeably die?</p>
<p>What has become of you,<br />
my disconsolate bedmate?</p>
<p>Are you able to follow the federal guidelines<br />
on loneliness,</p>
<p>that preposterous compromise?<br />
You can be lonely,</p>
<p>but you can’t tell anyone,<br />
nor can anyone ask.</p>
<p>If I had to guess: you’re probably married now<br />
with children,</p>
<p>an amiable enough, country-club sort<br />
of citizen, a lobbyist or defense contractor</p>
<p>preaching the gospel of national security<br />
while taking advantage of Pop’s</p>
<p>incomparable connections.<br />
(The old man like a base-runner</p>
<p>stranded at third,<br />
having made it to congressman, then senator,</p>
<p>then the loyal opposition’s<br />
Pentagon head.)</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>Last night I saw your father,<br />
the now former Secretary, on television.</p>
<p>He’s been hired as a commentator<br />
for the upcoming war.</p>
<p>“Soon, a squadron of bombers will swoop down<br />
over Baghdad,” he reported, “dropping</p>
<p>their loads, doing their dirty business<br />
in the dark.” Well,</p>
<p>he didn’t say that exactly,<br />
though his enthusiasm was nearly sexual.</p>
<p>America has begun its chant;<br />
outside, even the cicadas are preparing</p>
<p>for combat, pounding their thoraxes.<br />
In the first Gulf conflict,</p>
<p>pilots were given pornographic materials<br />
as a motivational tool.</p>
<p>“Go out and give it to her,” the men joked<br />
as they climbed up to their cockpits.</p>
<p>Then lifting the cumbersome lids,<br />
they rose into shame—</p>
<p>the entire country behind them.<br />
So many miles, so much distance.</p>
<p>Look, the dead crawl into their body bags<br />
alone. Remember playing</p>
<p>beneath the streets? Remember the warmth<br />
of my breath on your shoulder?</p>
<p>There wasn’t a girl between us<br />
nor yet a dream of war.</p>
