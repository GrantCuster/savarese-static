This is a static version of Ralph Savarese's website. It was originally a wordpress site. It contains the flat HTML files from the site, served through github pages.

If you are a developer trying to rebuild the site, I would strongly suggest just copying and pasting the content into something new. If you do want to try to get the wordpress version of the site running again, the `website_archive` directory contains the database export and the server files. There's a readme in there with further info.
