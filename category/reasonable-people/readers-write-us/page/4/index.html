			<p>Ralph,</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for writing an article on a topic that is needed in the Dallas/Fort Worth and Texas area. As a &#8216;northerner&#8217; that has been in Texas for almost four years, the Fundamentalist Christians and their lack of sensistivity has been astounding. It is simply chosen ignorance and hypocrisy. I was raised as a Christian in the Lutheran Church, LCA.</p>
<p>My daughter is adopted. We traveled to a foreign country to find our perfect little bundle of &#8216;special needs&#8217; child. She was two when I first met her. As in the United States, children above six months of age have decreasing percentage chances of adoption. By age five, a child, particularly in an overseas orphanage such as my daughter&#8217;s, has a one percent chance of finding a forever family. My daughter was displaying autistic type tendencies, as they referred to her behaviors, at the time of her adoption. She also displays scars from physical beatings either with her birth mother the first six months of her life or with orphanage personnel. The overseas doctor was very concerned that we might not want to adopt her with her challenges. Many other families had met her and chose not to. She still has challenging days. What is most amusing is when people comment how &#8216;normal&#8217; my child appears. As if the rest of us are truly &#8216;normal&#8217;! I love my child. Her originally labeled autistic type tendencies now are more so likely in another category of neurological. Now that she is has just reached age six, our adoption agency &#8216;up north&#8217; and other experts have recommended that her development is such that testing will now be able to guide us. Either way, she is my child. Yes, these children need our love, as well as we need theirs. My daughter has been the best that has ever happened to me. I&#8217;m sure you feel the same about your child. I try to educate those who do not understand what they are saying when they are aware of my daughter&#8217;s background. For those who would rather not be educated, I choose to leave them to their voluntary ignorance, in that is what they prefer and I have been things to do like spend time focusing on my child.</p>
<p>I commend you on your attempt to educate the Dallas/Fort Worth and Texas area residents. I must say though that it is possibly an effort in futility. Now as a college professor, and prior as a corporate executive, I have experience in the workplace fighting discrimination issues, etc. Dallas/Forth Worth has been my most challenging audience to date. As a note, I&#8217;m technically Caucasian, with this mindset. <img src='http://www.ralphsavarese.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Take care.</p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>

			<p>I tore through your stunning book in 3 nights, was blown away by it. On every level. Linguistic/intellectual fascination with trauma material finally trumped by sheer monumentality of your and Emily&#8217;s undertaking, DJ&#8217;s ability, and inspiration. I hope your book goes everywhere, and that you&#8217;re doing well in what must be a marathon.</p>

			<p>I cannot wait to read your book. My husband and I have recently begun to foster a young child with autism. I too am a teacher of children with autism. So, many people see only the autism I am lucky enough to have worked with enough of these little people that I can see the child. I met this child in my classroom and felt compelled to help she had been bounced with unsuccessful placements and she was in obvious distress. I was compelled to help and thank God my husband was willing. We have been through 3 extremely difficult months but the child is undeniably making progress. There has been moments when I have been concerned that this decision was to much of a change for my family. I had a few friends and colleagues question our decision saying think of your family and I said I am. I want to teach my kids to do what is right not what is easy. I was speaking to another friend and I said &#8220;It would have been easier to look the other way.&#8221; She responded, &#8220;Obviously, for you Dawn it wasn&#8217;t easier.&#8221; How accurate. Well, I just wanted to tell you just the sight of you book offered me relief that another person understood &#8211; this is a good choice. Helping a child is a good choice. Each time the guard comes down and we see this little child &#8211; her personality, her smile, her being we are lucky. God Bless you in your decision. Take Care.</p>

			<p>I wanted to thank you for an excellent article on your child. Enjoyed reading it very much. I also have an autistic child, who is now 23 yrs. old. (He is the asperger type) They all start out the same &#8211; confusion, not aware of what is going on. No communication. Didn&#8217;t know his name or ours. We were just people he lived with. Very sweet, like a puppy. People take advantage and mistreat them something awful. My son’s teachers were the worst. I finally home-schooled &#8211; I could not let them do what they did to him. To this day, they have no idea what they did.</p>
<p>With loving, kind and stick to it parents &#8211; they can become something.</p>
<p>I never thought mine could drive a car. He can. I never thought he would live on his own. He is. He finally graduated from UTD this year (after 7 years) and took a job in New York &#8211; marketing (yes) We are so proud of him. But only his close family knows what he went through and what it took.</p>
<p>I would rather have an autistic child, because they are so sweet, kind, giving (yes, in their own way) loving and when they do succeed, it means more than anything in this world.</p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy your son, it sounds like he will give you allot of love.</p>
<p>I would love to hear back from you and Michael would gladly talk about his aspergers.</p>
<p>He is still very sweet, kind and loving to all of mankind.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>A mom, who knows</p>

			<p>Dear Mr. Savarese,</p>
<p>I just read your article in today’s Dallas Morning News. I want you to know that I am not in the habit of writing to strangers, but I was touched by your story of your willingness to adopt an autistic child. My own daughter has been diagnosed with PDD and she is now 17.</p>
<p>She has been my pride &#038; joy but I worry about her constantly, most importantly for her future. At least she is able to verbalize her needs &#038; wants like your son communicates with you through the computer. I just wanted you to know that I applaud you &#038; your wife for taking on this challenging but ultimately rewarding responsibility. </p>

			<p>Well, I&#8217;m not Newsweek but here is my rave review. Really beautiful, reasonable book. I just finished it last night. Actually, I was so sucked in by it that it has been my companion every night for the past week. It is rare that I have the opportunity to respond to an author of a memoir who I know in &#8220;real life&#8221;, so I hope you&#8217;ll indulge me. I figure you wrote over 400 pages so the least I can do is write a lengthy email.</p>
<p>The experience of reading was changed by my remembering of Gainesville, Grinnell, you, your tone of voice and brief references you made in class that were elaborated in the book (such as the story about the poem and Charlie&#8217;s stroller). I was even able to picture Emily and DJ (though I never met them formally, I saw them when I was out walking at Krumm one day so I at least have a sketchy image). All of this made the reading experience wholly different.</p>
<p>I can forgive the GLAD trashbag reference because you quoted my favorite Annie Dillard essay (I keep a copy of it in my desk).</p>
<p>It is touching how you intermittently honor Emily in the book like a bird alighting on solid ground before flying off again. You make sure that we don&#8217;t forget her part.</p>
<p>At the end, when you discover that you don&#8217;t want DJ to focus only on trauma and the past and begin to be firm about establishing a different narrative for his life I was reminded of narrative psychotherapy (related, some might say, to constructivist therapy). It strikes me that you and DJ were practicing this kind of therapy. It&#8217;s attributed to a guy named White and if you haven&#8217;t heard of it you might find it interesting. It&#8217;s essentially about honoring people&#8217;s humanity by giving them the opportunity to &#8220;re-story&#8221; old, stuck narratives in a way that is more empowering for their present and future life. I was interested in many of your reflections on psychotherapy since I currently work as a therapist in private practice. (Not to worry- I also still work as a medical social worker with people who have end stage renal disease.)</p>
<p>I positively cried my eyes out during the parts about Charlie. You write sadness well. To me, those sections are some of the strongest and most effective in the book.</p>
<p>Of course, I took note of the handful of places where you touch on theology. We never discussed this but you had somewhat of a reputation at Grinnell as being anti-religion (my favorite quote that you uttered one day in class is this: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have antipathy toward religion, it just leaves me cold.&#8221;) In the book, I sensed the primary theological theme as being discomfort/anger with the notion of a God who acts either as puppeteer or who refuses to intervene in suffering when he/she could. I agree that this kind of God- omnipotent, controlling- is not worthy of devotion. I also strongly identified with your awkward feelings in the face of religious ritual. Towards the end of the book, when the tone of advocacy became strong, I started to think of Jesus&#8230;not roller skating rink blasting Christian music Jesus, but Jesus the friend and advocate of the poor and oppressed. I am opposed to all kinds of interpretations of Jesus- substitutionary atonement, son of God, on and on- but not that one and I thought of it when contemplating your ethic of social responsibility. Yes, all this from someone who spent three years in seminary and has been through an entire denominational ordination process. Call it research into humanity.</p>
<p>I so admire what you&#8217;ve accomplished in this book. The blending of your intelligence and emotion is artful. The courage to allow people to be voyeurs of your life, to lay yourself and your family out on the page in that way (especially in such a small community as Grinnell), is inspiring.</p>
<p>I will never think of the words &#8220;great&#8221; &#8220;possibly&#8221; &#8220;free&#8221; the same way again.</p>
<p>Best wishes as you tour around this summer.</p>

			<p>Hello Mr. Savarese,</p>
<p>I just read your Op-Ed and wanted to send you a note to thank you for your beautiful piece in the Times. I&#8217;m the mother of a very young boy (nearly 4) on the spectrum, and like your son he is a warm, bright and complicated kid. And like you, I get a lot of odd comments from people who mean to be helpful (or not, I suppose) and don&#8217;t quite know what to say. So I am grateful and delighted when I happen upon someone else who can convey the joy as well as the challenges of raising a different kind of kid. I&#8217;ve been very torn about all the attention to autism lately; it tends to go down the causation rathole, focus on scary therapies, or applaud the &#8220;courage&#8221; of the families and the &#8220;misery&#8221; they endure. That&#8217;s not our experience, and it sounds as though it isn&#8217;t yours either.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s taken me several days after finishing your book to even begin to find words to express what I think. It&#8217;s incredible, Ralph. Lizzie and I were fighting over who got to read it first, and finally we resorted to having two bookmarks in the same book. Neither of us could put it down. Of course, being in the periphery for some of your narrative (and even in the room at times!) helped draw me personally in, but I thought you had a perfect balance of your personal narrative, the drama of DJ&#8217;s language and development, and just enough academic and psychological content to ground it without making it heavy. As was evident from the first class I had with you, your passion is something that comes out in everything you do, and this book only further demonstrates that fact. I&#8217;m glad you decided to include so much dialogue &#8212; at first it felt a little like reading Gertrude Stein&#8217;s &#8220;Tender Buttons,&#8221; although comprehension was much easier to come by. It really made clear the sense of progression, and, eventually, DJ&#8217;s often poetic interpretation of the world. And the poem that you wrote for Charlie, my god. Rarely do my eyes tear up enough to force me to stop reading, but that poem did it. I realized that I haven&#8217;t encountered much of your poetry, if any. I remember trying to goad you into reading during our seminar, but to no avail. And now I know, after all these years, why you write your e-mails with one finger. All this time, I thought it was just a quirk of yours! I&#8217;m getting long-winded here, but I just wanted to commend you. &#8220;Reasonable People&#8221; really is a huge accomplishment. I&#8217;m sending a copy to my step-sister who works with autistic children in a public school in Des Moines. AND lest I forget to mention: Good luck at all of your readings, but especially at the one in a few days in Boston. You will be reading at the bookstore I used to work for: Porter Square Books! Everyone there is wonderful and I only wish I could be there.</p>

<p>As an individual on the autism spectrum (I am an Asperger&#8217;s Autistic), I enjoyed and appreciated your article in the LA Times. You present a healthy and important perspective that is sadly missing from the modern discussion about the autism spectrum, filled as it is with counterproductive and inaccurate terms such as &#8220;disease&#8221;, &#8220;epidemic&#8221; and &#8220;tragedy&#8221;.

<p>I loved your piece in the Los Angeles Times. All my best wishes to you, your wife and son, and I look forward to reading your book.</p>
<p>As someone who hopes to start a family of her own soon, I found your piece very inspiring. Whether born to parents or adopted by them, &#8220;special needs&#8221; or not, it is love and commitment that makes a family a family: and I know that whatever form the family my husband and I will create will take, it will require courage, compassion and fortitude, which your loving family appears to have in spades.</p>

			<p>I read your LA Times op-ed today and immediately forwarded it to my husband. Like you, we chose not to have biological children. We have just &#8212; in the last two weeks &#8212; decided to adopt a &#8220;special needs&#8221; child from China. What an extraordinary and disheartening revelation that the people, friends and family, who so enthusiastically welcomed the idea of a cute, smart Chinese baby into our world, fall quiet the minute the SN word is uttered. Their reaction caught us entirely off guard. We began to blab blab blab about our decision-making process and you could feel disquiet grow on the other end of the phone. We&#8217;ve become ever more cautious about who we tell what.</p>
<p>I really admire your courage, because it takes courage &#8212; that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking for from friends now &#8211; courage and hand-me-downs &#8212; to swim against the tide of neurotypical cowardly self-protective, in your marvelous inversion, &#8220;autistic&#8221; thinking and be so bold about it. Thank you!</p>

			<p>Thanks for sharing your experiences in such a wonderful, readable form. I have sent copies of your book to my three sisters, my nephew who is the father of a four-year-old autistic son, and my grandnephew who will, in some sort of miraculous arrangement of time and circumstance, be entering Grinnell next fall. It would seem that your work will benefit us all.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that called empowerment?</p>

			<p>I read Reasonable People this weekend. If facilitated communication is a practice meant to enable those who might otherwise go unheard to communicate with the assistance or support of others, then certainly we are all practitioners. As the various poetic invocations of the memoir demonstrate, your own voice is indelibly tied to the devices and inventive potentials of literature and poetry. In that spirit, I would like to conjure a philosophical voice which has augmented my own communication and summarizes my reactions to Reasonable People. This is a statement on pragmatist ethics which I admire for its particular willingness to substitute social and emotional relevancy for technical sophistication. “Moral development in the individual, and moral progress in the human species as a whole, is a matter of re-marking human selves so as to enlarge the variety of relationships which constitute those selves. […] Pragmatists think of moral progress as more like sewing together a very large, elaborate, polychrome quilt, than like getting a clearer vision of something true and deep. […]So it is best to think of moral progress as a matter of increasing sensitivity, increasing responsiveness to the needs of a larger and larger variety of people and things” (R. Rorty, Ethics without Principles, 1994).</p>
<p>The great achievement of Reasonable People is to confront social injustice through the life and actions of one family, without becoming politically sterile. The memoir inspires moral indignation and reasonable political expectations that we can all contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian society with efforts that are neither heroic nor unreasonable, but simply sensible individuals encouraged by compassion and interested in building a more creative and diverse social landscape which enriches our own lives. Americans are often ready to make ‘easy reading’ of memoirs such as Reasonable People, but the unique virtue of this work is that it denies its readers a packaged tale of triumph in adversity, and demands a confrontation with the circumstances of poverty in a collapsing welfare state, and the oftentimes inequitable perceptions of disability and difference which permeate our social (and scientific) lives. You will have to forgive the clumsiness of my evaluation and expression (as I lack any literary training), but Reasonable People is simply a beautiful act of impassioned love and rage. You managed to capture the almost oppressive sense of hopelessness and frustration which you, Emily, and DJ at times faced, while simultaneously capturing the enduring love and hope which paradoxically filled those same moments.</p>
<p>I also wanted to add a word to DJ. If his dream is to become a political freedom fighter, then he has certainly achieved more with respect to his aspirations than many of us can hope to do in a lifetime. In showing the courage to allow his story to be told, he has shown the determination and fearless spirit which it takes to inspire radical political action. I hope that he continues to write, and that Emily will soon publish an accompanying work on inclusion in the classroom, as the world is a certainly a richer place with the voices of all the Savareses in it.</p>
