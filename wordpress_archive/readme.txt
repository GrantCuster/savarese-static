File ralphsavarese_wordpress.sql contains the wordpress database for the entire ralph savarese site. See instructions here https://ph.godaddy.com/help/import-sql-files-into-mysql-databases-6802 for importing into MySQL.

The folder savarese contains all the files that used to be on the server for wordpress. In theory, you should be able to put that on a server, link it up with the database you imported the SQL file into, and have the wordpress site running again.
