<p>Michael had come to give a reading at the small Iowa college where I teach – it was as much an excuse to see me, his former student, as it was a chance to sell copies of his latest book. He was shocked, I think, by just how isolated the college is. Halfway between Des Moines, the capital, and Iowa City, where the University of Iowa is located, the town boasts a population of 9,000 and is surrounded on all sides by big, agribusiness farms. You can travel an hour in either direction on I-80, one of the highways that span the US, without seeing much of anything. You can travel downtown, for that matter, without seeing much of anything. And the food, well – let’s not go there, as Americans like to say.</p>

<p>RALPH JAMES SAVARESE</p>
<p>She had just won a major literary prize. She was slim, blond, and preposterously attractive. I was slim, blond, and preposterously awkward. Somehow I’d gotten into her poetry writing class as a first-semester freshman. I’d submitted a sonnet about a monk so consumed with sexual longing that he couldn’t pray. The monk was me, and the poem, of course, was awful. But because I seemed to know something about formal poetry and because she herself was obsessed with God (the thing my speaker should have been obsessed with), she decided, I guess, to let me in.</p>

<p>In the eighth grade, my son, DJ, who is autistic and who uses a text-to-voice synthesizer to communicate, became so distraught while learning about Harriet Tubman and a little Polish boy whom the Germans murdered that he couldn’t continue reading. His breathing was heavy; his eyes had glazed over. His heart pounded in the narrow cage of his chest. In response to his ninth-grade English teacher’s question, “What are your strengths as a reader?” he replied, “I feel characters’ feelings.” He then added, “Dread very scary books and wish I took breathing easy mom to class to create more security.”</p>

<h3>I: Diaphragms</h3>
<p>She discovered it in my brother&#8217;s dresser, stuffed beneath the tube socks, only partially concealed.  She&#8217;d been putting laundry away, lost as usual in the etherized loneliness of housework, when the saucer appeared, darting between the cumulus socks and stratocumulus underpants.  &#8220;It&#8217;s here to take me away,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;a UFO!&#8221; Or so I imagine, the pathos of the incident pushing back, these many yearls later, against the comedy.</p>
<p>And take her away it did.  When the object&#8217;s actual identity at last imposed itself on my mother&#8217;s consciousness, she felt faint.  She had to lie down on my brother&#8217;s bed, the very spot in which the saucer had landed.  A diaphragm?  Her fifteen-year-old son was having sex.  Her fifteen-year-old son was having sex with his fourteen-year-old girlfriend.  &#8220;Good God,&#8221; she whispered, as if trying to keep the revelation from herself.  Little did she know that an even greater shock lay ahead.  Although hardly in bed <em>with</em> her progeny, shouldn&#8217;t she have sensed, lying atop his comforter, this final outrage?  Wasn&#8217;t there something about the diaphragm she ought to have recognized.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <em>Stone Canoe</em>: A Journal of Arts and Ideas from Upstate New York (Spring 2008, No. 2):</p>
<h3>1. &#8220;Sad Dear Saved Me&#8221;</h3>
<p>&#8220;Hours of light like heat hibernate/great icebergs hear the cries of hurt.&#8221; So, my son, adopted at the age of six from foster care, began a poem entitled, &#8220;Alaska.&#8221; Written on a communcation device in the fifth grade, it establishes a number of exquisite analogies&#8211;between light and bears and calving icebergs and &#8220;hurt&#8221; people. By &#8220;hurt&#8221; people he means kids such as himself who were abandoned by their parents, kids with disabilities forced to survive in a land of unremitting darkness.</p>
<p>That darkness included the worst sort of physical and sexual abuse and you can see him find in the natural setting of Alaska the unlit bedroom in which the abuse took place.  Indeed, you can see him find the saga of his entire early life: separation from his parents and sister, then frigid loneliness and injury&#8211;the two compressed into an image that does not behave, as my sentence just did, chronologically.  The awful calving refers <em>both</em> to the loss of family and to the physical experience of rape, of being split open, as my son explained almost too matter-of-factly.  At once inarticulate and faintly human, the sound of that calving seems an apt correlative for the cry of childhood trauma&#8211;especially apt in the case of a boy who literally cannot speak and who, back then, had no way of communicating what was happening to him.</p>
<p>As Alaska waits in winter for warmth it can barely imagine coming, so my son waited for relief from his attacker and, even less probably, for parents who might love him. &#8220;Yes. dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes.,&#8221; he typed recently on his talking computer.  We had been conversing about the past&#8211;in particular, my decision not to have kids and my own experience of depression.  And there he was the voice of triumphant spring, in all of its freshness, reminding me to be hopeful. Remind me in that language, that poetry, I have come to think of as &#8220;Autie-type.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <em>American Disasters,</em> Edited by Steven Biel:</p>
<p>History, wrote the German-Jewish critic Walter Benjamin in 1940 is “one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage.”  Inspired by Benjamin’s hope of jolting history out of its catastrophic standstill, Ralph James Savarese seeks the uptopian possibilities in the 1982 Air Florida crash in Washington, D.C.—in the heroism of the mysterious “man in the water” who came to the rescue of his fellow passengers and the convict-con artist who posed as a priest to comfort the bereaved families of the victims.  Defying the formal conventions of traditional history and criticism, Savarese creates a “remembrance&#8221; of the disaster that is imagistic and analytical.  His essay juxtaposes scenes of the crash with descriptions of Ronal Reagan’s ruthless suppression of the air traffic controllers’ strike a few months earlier, discussions of the history of aviation and illuminating refererences to Sigmund Freud, Herman Mellville, Karl Marx, Walker Percy, and others who have ruminated on trauma and rescue.</p>
