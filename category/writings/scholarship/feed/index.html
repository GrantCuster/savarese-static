			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From <em>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience</em> 7.6 (2013). On-line. </strong></p>
<p>(Commentary on “Rethinking autism: implications of sensory and motor differences,” an article by Anne Donnellan, David Hill, and Martha Leary)</p>
<p>Ralph J. Savarese</p>
<p>Humanities Writ Large Fellow, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA</p>
<p>This triad of clinicians and researchers has been advancing a sensorimotor perspective on autism for years; at last, the scientific community is beginning to catch up. Since the article&#8217;s initial publication in Disability Studies Quarterly, the sensorimotor hypothesis has garnered even more support (Donnellan et al., 2010). For example, a meta-analysis from 2010 concluded, “ASD is associated with significant and widespread alterations in motor performance” (Fournier et al., 2010). The article went so far as to propose that motor differences constitute a “core element” of autism and that “interventions aimed at improving … motor coordination (i.e., gait and balance, arm functions, and movement planning)” should be considered. A study from 2011 found that gross and fine motor differences in autistic children increased significantly with “each 6-month period of chronological age” (Lloyd et al., 2011). It recommended “addressing motor development in early intervention treatments.” And a study from 2012 reported that “motor skills were substantially impaired among ASD-affected children and highly correlated with autistic severity and IQ” (Hilton et al., 2012). By looking at the siblings of autistic children and finding in them no equivalent impairment, the study was able to directly link sensorimotor disturbances with ASD. It, too, contended that motor impairment is a “core characteristic” of autism and that treatment should reflect this fact. The tide has clearly shifted with respect to the sensorimotor hypothesis; what was once dismissed out of hand by an earlier generation of autism researchers is now increasingly being taken up for its superior explanatory power.</p>

<p>This article underscores the importance of coupling a practical orientation to the many challenges of autism with a philosophical and political orientation that refuses merely to make room for disability in the classroom or to accommodate its specific needs. It uses a case study approach to illustrate the ways in which subject matter and narrative convention were problematic for a nonspeaking, autistic boy who had been abused in foster care. The article focuses on his elementary and middle school years to illustrate the way in which an understanding of disability studies must inform our reading pedagogy if marginalized children are to find a safe place in our classrooms and our communities.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <em>Inflexions 5</em>, “Simondon: Milieu, Techniques, Aesthetics” (March 2012). 184-223.</p>
<p>In his short commentary [2] on a “papal red” painting entitled “Birds would  violate airline dapper standards for appearance but the skies sport vivider dayglo colors when it can fly freely and uncensored by mankind” (Biklen 2005: 179),  autistic painter Larry Bissonnette imagines a realm of unencumbered artistic activity.  “Not allowing people with disabilities their patterns of inspiring art through total freedom of expression,” he reiterates, “is like limiting creativity with censorship” (Biklen 2005: 179). As he notes in another commentary, [3] part of which serves as the essay’s first epigraph, verisimilitude doesn’t interest him; rather, he paints to his senses, and the  senses in autism are often especially charged. With tremendous wit he links the “vivider dayglo colors” of the painting’s skies with the birds’ freedom to soar as they wish.  There would be a violation of airliner decorum, he contends, if winged restrictions—what he figures as censorship&#8211;were in place.</p>

<p>It is all the rage, in autism circles, to diagnose a particular historical or literary figure as autistic. Some scholars have even diagnosed fictional characters—Bartleby, for example—as being on the spectrum. When I began writing this chapter, I had just finished a book on autism, and I was seeing it everywhere. I knew that I wanted to analyze disability in <em>Billy Budd</em>—both stuttering and cognitive difference—and I thought that Hans Asperger’s idea of “an intelligence scarcely touched by tradition or culture&#8230; strangely pure” (qtd. in Sacks, 252–253) might be a profitable lens through which to view Melville’s “upright barbarian” (110), that “child man . . . [whose] simplemindedness [had] remained unaffected” by experience or age (135). As Melville puts it, “Experience is a teacher indeed; yet did Billy’s years make his experience small” (136). I wanted to historicize the Handsome Sailor’s “essential innocence” (162), rescue it, for a time, from the brilliance of symbol and allegory by asking questions about how the nineteenth century understood stuttering and cognitive disability.</p>
