			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally published in the &#8220;Autism Research Institute Adults with ASD eBulletin.”</p>
<p>My son, DJ, leaves for Ohio in a few weeks. He was admitted to Oberlin College, a highly selective institution, last spring and decided to take a gap year to work on a film he has been making with Rob Rooy about his inclusion experience and to practice greater independence. He aspires to be the first nonspeaking person with autism to go away to a residential college and live in the dorms. There may be as few as ten nonspeaking autists,<a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a> but certainly no more than twenty, in the United States who have earned a college degree, and all of them, so far as we know, have lived off-campus while going to school.</p>
<p>Although DJ could have attended Grinnell College, where I teach, and lived comfortably at home in Iowa, he chose Oberlin. Aside from simply liking it better than other institutions, he was impressed by Oberlin’s record of inclusion: the school accepted the first female and African-American students in the United States. Why not the first nonspeaking person with autism to live in the dorms? Inspired by those who have broken barriers before him, DJ is driven to do the same for those who come after. Included in a regular school from the day that my wife and I adopted him at the age of six, he insists on his right to a productive and meaningful life, and he asks that we all labor imaginatively to help make this possible.</p>
<p>Although he won’t matriculate until next fall, DJ is moving to Oberlin in order to prepare for this event. He needs to acclimate himself to very different surroundings; he needs to hire a team that will support him in and out of the classroom; he needs to familiarize college personnel with his particular neurological difference and the accommodations it requires; and, as he typed on his iPad, he &#8220;needs to find dear, reasonable people who will help allay [his] fear.&#8221; The labor and expense will be prodigious—think NASA preparing for the first man on the moon—but my son deserves a shot at his dream, having worked harder at his studies than any young person I know. Thankfully, Oberlin has said that it is committed to learning how to facilitate his success. By moving to Ohio seven months early, DJ hopes to be ready for that first night in the dorm and that first day in class.</p>
<p>Fortunately for DJ, Oberlin offers a greater variety of on-campus housing and dining options than most liberal arts colleges. First- and second-year students can live in a dorm that is, or is not, substance-free (the term that colleges use to designate spaces where neither drugs nor alcohol can be consumed) or in a student-run co-operative house. Singles, doubles, triples and some quads are available. A few rooms even come with their own bathroom. Students can eat in either one of the two cafeterias, or they can be a dining member of a student-run co-op. Third- and fourth-year students have even more options. When I asked DJ what his preferences were, he typed the following:</p>
<p>I want to live where I feel safe and free to be myself without the stress of having to act normal. Home is safe because my mom and dad make me feel hopeful that changing people&#8217;s attitudes toward nonspeaking autists is possible. As I go to college, I am hoping to create a really supportive community of fresh-thinking people who view me as caring and created as equal. I dread confronting people who misunderstand me or who underestimate autists. Dread creates fear. Resting in my quiet room helps me desert fear. I feel like a single room is necessary, so I have a loving space where I can reassess myself as the smart, respectable person I am. Right now I am leaning toward living in the substance-free dorm. I know from experience that drugs and drinking create dangerous situations in which even friends can become untrustworthy. Cafeterias are fearful because they serve food that really feels dreadful in my breathing easy body. At Oberlin, students can eat in student run co-ops where the food is healthier. I hope to join a co-op that offers fresh fruit and meat. Treating me as free to make my own decisions feels fearful but hopeful. In my mind, Oberlin College&#8217;s golden buildings represent hope, and hope breaks barriers.</p>
<p>As his father, I want DJ to understand that even if it doesn’t work out, he is a success. It may be that this sort of pioneering demands too much of a nonspeaking person with autism. Perhaps he will decide to live off-campus or even leave for a college closer to home. Perhaps Oberlin just won’t be ready for this kind of experience yet; despite wanting in the abstract to be inclusive, much more preparatory work on its end might need to be done. Who knows? Nothing about our journey as a family has been certain. At each step, there have been seemingly insurmountable obstacles: getting DJ out of foster care, including him in a regular school, teaching him how to read and to type, helping him to transition to middle school and then to high school, getting him ready to take the ACTs and to apply to colleges. Many wonderful people have helped us on our journey, and though we’re starting from scratch in a new town and at a new institution, we believe in the future.</p>

<p>So Frederick Douglass describes the impact of learning to read in his autobiography. &#8220;It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>My son, DJ, recently used this passage as an epigraph for his college admission essay, comparing his predicament as a nonspeaking person with autism who had been taught to read and to type on a computer to that of a famous, mid-19th century American slave. What use is knowledge, DJ asks, if it can&#8217;t be developed and mobilized to improve one&#8217;s life?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a freshman in high school, I had a bit part in a community-theater production of Arthur Miller&#8217;s &#8220;The Crucible.&#8221; With John Proctor raging against the trial that would convict him of witchcraft, Judge Danforth was supposed to exclaim, &#8220;Do you doubt my probity?&#8221; But instead, the roly-poly adolescent playing him yelled, &#8220;Do you doubt my puberty?&#8221; which elicited tremendous guffaws from the audience. The kid&#8217;s puberty was indeed in doubt. Baby fat and a squeaky voice made it almost impossible to accept the high seriousness of the drama. With one slip, this famous American tragedy turned tragically comic. Even at the end of the play, as Proctor was being hanged and as Miller&#8217;s implied critique of McCarthyism resounded, some in the audience were still guffawing.</p>
<p>I thought of this gaffe when my 16-year-old son, a sophomore with autism, asked on his talking computer, &#8220;Will I ever get to have sex?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; my wife and I responded, committed to the creative problem solving we&#8217;d practiced from the moment our adopted son arrived in diapers and carrying the label of profound mental retardation at the age of 6. That little boy is now a young man: He&#8217;s 5-foot-10; he&#8217;s shaving. He&#8217;s also a straight-A, honor-roll student at our local high school. He has appeared on CNN with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and given speeches all over the country on the importance of self-determination. What&#8217;s a little sex compared to the obstacles he&#8217;s already overcome? I mused.</p>
<p>In effect, my son was asking, &#8220;Do you doubt my puberty?&#8221; But for him, as for so many other people with cognitive differences, the issue isn&#8217;t humorous. When you consider the shame that people attach to disability generally and the near hysteria that greets disabled sex in particular, my son&#8217;s concern shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone. Just two years ago, America learned that Arthur Miller fathered a boy with Down syndrome, a boy he abandoned at an institution and never told anyone about. Only at the end of his life did this defender of the politically oppressed bother to visit his son. When he did, he was reportedly shocked that the 40-year-old Daniel had a job and lived largely independently.</p>
<p>A year earlier, the media reported on a girl whose parents had authorized the removal of her breast buds and uterus and the injection of high doses of estrogen to prevent puberty and keep her small. The parents thought it would be easier to care for Ashley, whom they dubbed the &#8220;Pillow Angel,&#8221; when she was older, and a hospital ethics board approved this &#8220;growth attenuation&#8221; for &#8220;static encephalopathy.&#8221; The hospital, however, violated state law by not submitting the procedure to court review. The public uproar was tremendous, and one of Ashley&#8217;s two doctors ended up committing suicide.</p>
<p>Many supported the procedure, but an adult woman with &#8220;static encephalopathy,&#8221; who communicates by pointing at a vertical letter board, criticized the &#8220;readiness with which Ashley&#8217;s parents, doctors and most commentators assumed they could make an accurate estimation of the understanding of a child without speech who has severely restricted movement.&#8221; As the woman, Anne McDonald, explained, the presumption of a lack of intelligence governed their attitudes.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&#8217;ve come a long way from the incarceration, sterilization, and eugenics of the 20th century, but not far enough. The dream of full participation in life&#8217;s richness for those with cognitive differences remains just that: a dream. Who of us doesn&#8217;t want a job, a home and friends? Who of us doesn&#8217;t want a share of that sublime and affirming activity we call sex (or what my son at age 12 memorably termed &#8220;great feelings&#8221;)? We need to stop behaving like hysterical Puritans and provide people with disabilities with rigorous sex education. Not only that but opportunities, even trained sexual facilitators, if need be. Kids with disabilities grow up. Let them look forward to what the rest of us look forward to. We can do this responsibly, ethically.</p>
<p>A journalist covering the Arthur Miller story suggested that in the forsaken relationship with Daniel, Miller was &#8220;sitting on his greatest unwritten play.&#8221; My own son just received a &#8220;Division I&#8221; rating in the state theater competition with a work about autism that he wrote and helped to direct. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Plotting Hope,&#8221; and I like to think of it as filling a void that Miller simply couldn&#8217;t imagine.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Reasonable people promote very easy breathing,&#8221; my adopted son, DJ, once typed. For this non-speaking boy with autism, abandoned at the age of three and literally tortured in foster care, anxiety remains his biggest challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your breathing would make me nervous,&#8221; he wrote to his teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him. &#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write?&#8221; he remonstrated them. &#8220;I very much value teachers who give nice instructions breathing easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, he extolled his time in a regular classroom: &#8220;Easy, quiet breathing waits to hear my words, and respect grows. Awesome, caring teachers read my writing and reward me by writing back.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if DJ, a sixth-grader, had transformed the primary, physical symptom of his anxiety &#8212; heavy breathing &#8212; into a political concept.</p>
<p>In this way, the amelioration of anxiety has been inexorably tied to the experience of inclusion: of being wanted by family, school, and community. &#8220;Breathing feels great now,&#8221; he declared on his talking computer during an especially good stretch in the sixth grade. &#8220;Breathing feels kind of like joy. When I&#8217;m breathing easily, I&#8217;m sort of like respected kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can respected adults breathe easily about autism? For one thing, we can promote inclusion as an opportunity to get to know autistic individuals. Such interaction would help to debunk the idea of a catastrophic disorder that precludes awareness of self and others. For too long scientists have terrorized us with this claim.</p>
<p>For another, we can devote more research money to improving the quality of life for people with autism. For every two studies on the cause, or causes, of autism, there ought to be at least one on the goal of autistic self-fulfillment. With richly rewarding lives as the norm, non-autistics might be less hysterical about finding a cure.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: autism presents significant, sometimes monumental, challenges. DJ, for example, is unable to speak, has sensory processing difficulties, and engages in repetitive behavior.</p>
<p>And yet, the boy who was labeled profoundly retarded when he came to live with us at the age of six is now a straight &#8220;A&#8221; student in a regular school, testing off the charts and using a computer to communicate. He&#8217;s also the most empathetic and politically conscious young person I know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that we can move forward with a vigorous research agenda while respecting the person with autism. But we have to make room for this difference in the world. We have to reduce the stigma attached to it. At the same time, we have to provide more support for parents who frequently find themselves at the ends of their ropes.</p>
<p>A few years ago, DJ was asked to compose a paragraph about the American flag for an Elks Club writing contest. His paragraph went like this: &#8220;The great United States of America is breathtakingly not free. Equality is not sacred because not everyone has access to it. Free people treat my people, very smart people who type to communicate, as mindless&#8230;. The creators of everyone&#8217;s very important Declaration of Independence wasted their breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was a boy demanding his place in America. I took note of the signature metaphor and pictured democracy itself in respiratory distress.</p>
<p>Recently, DJ was much more sanguine &#8212; and serene &#8212; in an essay comparing the plight of his &#8220;people&#8221; with that of African Americans; he&#8217;d just studied the civil rights movement. &#8220;I imagine my words resembling dead Martin Luther King&#8217;s respectful vision,&#8221; he typed.</p>
<p>Might we neurotypicals mirror such equanimity when confronting the challenges of autism?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Why would anyone adopt a badly abused, autistic 6-year-old from foster care?&#8221;</p>
<p>So my wife and I were asked at the outset of our adoption-as-a-first-resort adventure. It was a reasonable question in this age of narrow self-concern — far more reasonable, or at least more reasonably put, than many of the other questions we fielded.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have your own children?&#8221; a wealthy relative inquired, as if natural family-making were a kind of gated community it was best never to abandon. &#8220;You two have such good genes,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Why waste them?&#8221;</p>
<p>A colleague at work confronted me in the mailroom with this memorable gem: &#8220;Have you tried in-vitro?&#8221; She feared that we hadn&#8217;t availed ourselves of the many wondrous technologies that rescue infertile couples. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be better than adopting a child with a disability?&#8221; she asked, drawing out the word &#8220;disability.&#8221; &#8220;God knows what that kid&#8217;s parents were doing when they conceived him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not infertile,&#8221; I barked. &#8220;We have a relationship with the boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>My wife, an autism expert, had offered his mother services, but as the woman found it increasingly difficult to care for her son and then dropped out of the picture altogether, we&#8217;d started spending time with him. His first communicative act with language, at age 3 — the sign for &#8220;more&#8221; — we&#8217;d taught him while tickling his belly.</p>
<p>He later made that sign in the emergency room of a hospital where he was brought after being beaten in foster care. Upon seeing us — we&#8217;d been called in to try to calm him — he stopped in his tracks, paused (as if to allow some associative chain to complete itself) and demanded obsessively to be tickled. I remember searching on his chest for unbruised patches among the purple, blue and black. He was that frantic in his quest for the familiar and, dare I say, for love.</p>
<p>To this day, I can&#8217;t believe how callous people were; the strange anxiety that adopting a child with a disability provoked. And the anxiety just kept coming. &#8220;Healthy white infants must be tough to get,&#8221; a neighbor commented. No paragons of racial sensitivity, we were nevertheless appalled by the idea that we&#8217;d do anything to avoid adopting, say, a black child or a Latino one.</p>
<p>As offensive was the assumption that we must be devout Christians: hyperbolic, designated do-gooders with a joint eye firmly on some final prize. &#8220;God&#8217;s reserving a special place for you,&#8221; we heard on more than one occasion, as if our son deserved pity and we were allowed neither our flaws nor a different understanding of social commitment. The journalist Adam Pertman, in his otherwise excellent book, &#8220;Adoption Nation,&#8221; reproduces this logic exactly when he speaks of &#8220;children so challenging that only the most saintly among us would think [my italics] of tackling their behavioral and physical problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the stigma attached to &#8220;special-needs children,&#8221; people do adopt these kids. And yet, many more Americans spend gobs of money on fertility treatments or travel to foreign countries to find their perfect little bundles. I&#8217;m haunted by something my son wrote after we taught him how to read and type on a computer: &#8220;I want you to be proud of me. I dream of that because in foster care I had no one.&#8221; How many kids lie in bed at night and think something similar?</p>
<p>The physical and behavioral problems have been significant, at times even crushing. The last eight years have been devoted almost exclusively to my son&#8217;s welfare: literacy training, occupational therapy, relationship building, counseling for post-traumatic stress — the list goes on and on. But what strides he has made.</p>
<p>The boy who was still in diapers and said to be retarded when he came to live with us is now a straight-A student at our local middle school. He&#8217;s literally rewriting the common scripts of autism and &#8220;attachment disorder&#8221; (the broad diagnosis for the problems of abandoned and traumatized kids). These are hopeless scripts, unforgiving scripts in which the child can&#8217;t give back.</p>
<p>My son does, and others can as well. Recently, in response to my hip replacement, he typed on his computer, &#8220;I&#8217;m nervous because Dad has not brought me braces [his word for crutches].&#8221; I was just home from the hospital — wobbly, a bit depressed, in pain. To my question, &#8220;Why do you need crutches?&#8221; he responded endearingly, &#8220;You know how I like to be just like you.&#8221; My son was trying to make me feel better, taking on my impairment, limping with me.</p>
