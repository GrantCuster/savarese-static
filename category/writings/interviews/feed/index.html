<p>Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay is a twenty-one year old man with what the medical community would describe as &#8220;severe&#8221; or &#8220;low-functioning&#8221; autism. He grew up in India and came to America with his mother at the age of 13. He is the author of three books: The Mind Tree, The Gold of the Sunbeams, and How Can I Talk If My Lips Don&#8217;t Move? The first of these Tito wrote between the ages of 8 and 11, and I would venture to say that it is the best book ever written by anyone under the age of twelve. But even this description doesn&#8217;t do justice to just how sophisticated and writerly it is. Many an accomplished professional would sell their souls to have authored this book — or Tito&#8217;s others, for that matter.</p>

<p>I sat down with celebrated author Stephen Kuusisto in the fall of 2008 in Iowa City, Iowa where he lives. I had read his first book of poems, <em>Only Bread, Only Light</em>, and his two memoirs, the hugely popular <em>Planet of the Blind</em> and the recently released <em>Eavesdropping: A Memoir of Blindness and Listening</em>. I had also read his completed new manuscript of poems, <em>Mornings with Borges</em>, forthcoming from Copper Canyon Press in 2010. Having already met Steve when I invited him to give a reading and workshop at Grinnell College, I was familiar with his old guide dog, Vidal, who had just retired, but not his new dog, Nira, who seemed a paragon of affectionate placidity and navagational competence. Over several cups of coffee, we spoke about a great many things but kept circling back to questions of the lyric mode and its usefulness to the project of disability studies. Steve is a wildly energetic man, learned, unbelievably funny—a kind of walking surrealist. Think Johnny Carson meets André Breton meets the entire library at the University of Iowa, where he teaches in the graduate nonfiction program and the eye clinic at the medical college. He is also a passionate activist working on behalf of those with disabilities. A truly public intellectual, he has appeared on countless national and regional TV and radio programs, including <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, <em>Dateline NBC</em>, and NPR’s <em>Talk of the Nation</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NLMFF</strong>: What inspired you to write this book? What did you hope to accomplish through writing this book? </p>
<p><strong>Savarese</strong>: At first, I intended the book as a kind of advocacy on behalf of those who could not represent themselves: namely poor, disabled kids in foster care. But as my adopted son became literate, my plan for the book changed. I knew that I wanted to include his words in the book and even end the project with a chapter written by him. In this way, the book would embody the movement from advocacy to self-advocacy, representation to self-representation. Ultimately, my hope is that people will re-think the classical Autist—whom Oliver Sacks once described, very disparagingly, as “the creature for whom very little future lies in store.” My son, who once carried a label of profound mental retardation, is now a fully included, honor roll student at our local middle school; he most certainly does have a future, and others with classical autism do as well.</p>
