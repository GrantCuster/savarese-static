No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there''s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there''s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

at BuddyCamp Miami with a mobile app created for any WordCamps that are being broadcasted via WP Armchair. His team is releasing the AppBuddy beta today to their customers who have purchased the Agency bundle.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/appbuddy.png" rel="prettyphoto[22605]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/appbuddy.png?resize=281%2C500" alt="appbuddy" class="alignright size-large wp-image-22613" /></a>The app is being distributed from <a href="http://wparmchair.com/" target="_blank">wparmchair.com</a> and is in both of the app stores. It allows users to upload and share images and includes an appified profile page, the ability to add friends and join groups, send and receive private messages and post activity updates, just as you would on a standard BuddyPress site.</p>\n<p>Currently, the AppBuddy development team is focusing on getting everything to load faster via local storage. Native access to the device&#8217;s camera is already baked into the app. Push notifications are on the roadmap to be added within the next few weeks, allowing users to get live updates for BuddyPress-related notices. In the future, the team hopes to allow for access to the device&#8217;s contacts so that users can easily invite friends to the network.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern is on the ground at BuddyCamp where Messenlehner announced the app. He believes that AppBuddy will open up a new dimension of interaction for BuddyPress communities. &#8220;AppBuddy gives anyone the ability to build social apps and duplicate the functionality of their websites,&#8221; he said.  <strong>&#8220;It is a powerful tool for people who have big ideas but don&#8217;t have the development skills to realize them and don&#8217;t want to spend $100,000 developing a custom app.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Creating native apps for both iOS and Android can easily set you back a hefty sum of cash, given that it requires commissioning work from developers skilled in developing for both platforms. AppBuddy makes it possible for anyone to launch a native app for a BuddyPress social network, at a fraction of the cost. In a way, this extension serves to democratize the creation of social mobile apps through open source software.</p>\n<p>A responsive theme is probably the most common way that BuddyPress site owners can offer mobile access, but this still involves the user having to navigate to it in a mobile browser and bookmark the URL. If you want to implement a true app-style mobile experience for your BuddyPress social network, AppBuddy is currently the most cost-effective option. It&#8217;s not yet on the market but will be out of beta within a week or two. Download the app via the app stores or from <a href="http://wparmchair.com" target="_blank">wparmchair.com</a> to check out how AppBuddy is powering social interactions at WordCamps.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 09 May 2014 19:20:13

Much of the work that goes on in this area is invisible to the vast majority of users. Accessibility experts are generally in shorter supply than other types of contributors as well. Why aren’t more people involved in this important aspect of the web?</p>\n<p><a href="http://davidakennedy.com/" target="_blank">David Kennedy</a> has been an active member of the WordPress Accessibility team for more than a year, and he believes that accessibility can be an artful science. His involvement began shortly after he started working on <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/accessible-zen" target="_blank">Accessible Zen</a>, a free accessible WordPress theme. This led him to attend the weekly IRC meetings and contribute by testing patches.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/davidkennedy.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22333]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/davidkennedy.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="davidkennedy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-22576" /></a>Kennedy first started learning about the basics of web accessibility while working for <a href="http://wptavern.com/feed">The Arc</a>, a national nonprofit that helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The more he dug into it, the more he enjoyed it. Now it’s part of his daily life as a frontend developer and contributor to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Digging Deeper to Find the Beauty of Web Accessibility</h3>\n<p>I asked Kennedy to give us a window into why so few people are drawn to get involved with accessibility.</p>\n<p>“The answers to web accessibility challenges and problems aren&#8217;t always clear,” he said. &#8220;So much of the right approach often depends on the context of the website or web application in question.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Harnessing the right solution will often require delving deeper into the specifics of the content you’re trying to communicate. Kennedy cites a specific example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The alt attribute you write for an image on Site A can be vastly different than the alt attribute for the same image on Site B. Why? Each site&#8217;s content is vastly different. This stumps a lot of talented web workers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Accessibility improvements are often implemented under the surface of the application and Kennedy says that the goal is to keep them invisible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When web accessibility is done right, it&#8217;s undetectable. So it&#8217;s not something designers, developers or users can see to make a note of for future inspiration. You have to dig deeper to find the beauty in web accessibility. But trust me, it&#8217;s there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kennedy and other WordPress accessibility contributors are working together to improve the application along these lines with an initial focus on modernizing their testing tools.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Contributors Are Collaborating With the Drupal Accessibility Team To Automate Testing</h3>\n<p>The WordPress Accessibility team is <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2014/05/02/automated-accessibility-testing/" target="_blank">moving toward automating testing</a> in order to improve its efficiency. Kennedy hopes that automated testing will bring accessibility improvements to a new level, as well as help to educate other types of contributors, i.e. designers and developers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Its biggest benefits include helping us find simple errors, like missing form labels or missing alt attributes, and alerting us to potentially large trouble spots within code that may need more manual testing. Automated accessibility testing also shows many developers that accessibility is as much a code quality issue as it is a design and user interface challenge.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pursuant to that goal, Kennedy contacted <a href="http://jessebeach.github.io/" target="_blank">Jesse Beach</a> from the Drupal project. She is a contributor to <a href="http://quailjs.org/" target="_blank">QuailJS</a>, a jQuery plugin for checking content against accessibility guidelines. The Drupal Accessibility team already <a href="http://opensource.com/business/14/5/new-release-drupal-8-accessibility-advantage" target="_blank">has this in the bag</a> and the application is well-known for its attention to web accessibility guidelines. Their input has been invaluable to WordPress contributors, who may opt for incorporating QuailJS or a similar tool as part of their testing suite, depending on what fits.</p>\n<p>Some of WordPress’ accessibility team members have joined in the Drupal Accessibility Group’s Skype chat and a few Drupal members have jumped in on the WordPress IRC chats. They’re brainstorming new ways to keep the conversation going for improving both projects.</p>\n<p>What exactly do WordPress and Drupal have to gain by collaborating on accessibility? Kennedy has a few thoughts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At a broad level? More accessible, open software meaning that more people can create content on the web. Deeper than that? More efficient processes around managing accessibility in large, open software projects.</p>\n<p>Potentially, a unified way to approach new accessibility web standards, meaning if both Drupal and WordPress adopt a standard quickly, it might help push browser makers to move sooner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Modernizing the testing tools that WordPress accessibility contributors have at their disposal is the first step towards getting on the same page.</p>\n<h3>Making WordPress Accessibility More Approachable for New Contributors</h3>\n<p>The accessibility team remains rather small, with just a handful of regular contributors. But you don’t have to be an established accessibility wizard to join the team. Kennedy offers a new way to look at the field.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Web accessibility crosses all disciplines and touches every aspect of the web. But many people don&#8217;t realize they already have what it takes to make a project accessible. We have to embrace that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good web accessibility comes down to making informed decisions, making sure the people involved have an awareness of accessibility and paying attention to the smallest of details throughout,” he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Notice I didn&#8217;t mention anything about design, specific accessibility standards or coding. It usually starts with asking the question, &#8216;How&#8217;s this really going to work?&#8217; Anyone can help us do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more, join the WordPress accessibility team at <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/" target="_blank">make.wordpress.org/accessibility</a>. You’ll find a group of contributors who are passionate about making the web a better place.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 May 2014 20:54:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WordPress.tv: John James Jacoby: WordPress’s Role Based Access Control – WPRBACOMGBBQ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=34534";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/08/john-james-jacoby-wordpresss-role-based-access-control-wprbacomgbbq/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:730:"<div id="v-wU6eIUq9-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/34534/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/34534/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=34534&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/08/john-james-jacoby-wordpresss-role-based-access-control-wprbacomgbbq/"><img alt="John James Jacoby: WordPress’s Role Based Access Control &#8211; WPRBACOMGBBQ" src="http://videos.videopress.com/wU6eIUq9/video-ceb1da387f_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 May 2014 18:42:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.9.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=3241";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2014/05/wordpress-3-9-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3072:"<p>After three weeks and more than 9 million downloads of <a title="WordPress 3.9 “Smith”" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2014/04/smith/">WordPress 3.9</a>, we&#8217;re pleased to announce that WordPress 3.9.1 is now available.</p>\n<p>This maintenance release fixes 34 bugs in 3.9, including numerous fixes for multisite networks, customizing widgets while previewing themes, and the updated visual editor.

The panel consisted of the following people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ben Welch-Bolen CEO of <a title="http://www.site5.com/" href="http://www.site5.com/">Site 5</a></li>\n<li>Tenko Nikolov CEO of <a title="http://siteground.com/" href="http://siteground.com/">Siteground</a></li>\n<li>Vanessa Vasile Tier 3 Systems Architecture Lead of <a title="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/" href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/">InMotion Hosting</a></li>\n<li>James Grierson VP Business Development of <a title="http://www.bluehost.com/" href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a></li>\n<li>Ryan Sullivan Founder of <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com">WP Site Care</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>While the entire show was filled with great information, these are the statements that really caught my attention:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>75% of customer sites</strong> on Site 5 are powered by WordPress. This is the reason for setting up an optimized server configuration specifically for WordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>50% of users</strong> on Bluehost have WordPress installed on their account.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s The Biggest Security Threat Affecting Hosts?</h3>\n<p>Brute force login attempts were labeled as one of the biggest threats to webhosting. Hosts are getting increasingly aggressive in protecting users and forcing customers to use strong passwords. The majority of those on the panel stated they are blocking thousands of requests per second of automated attacks. 80-90% of the attacks are determined to be automated.</p>\n<p>Welch of Site 5 explained how the core of WordPress has been solid for the past two years. The focus has now shifted towards themes and plugins for security and performance issues.</p>\n<h3>How Do They Contribute Back To WordPress?</h3>\n<p>Siteground has a contractor who works for them but also contributes to the core of WordPress. Siteground is pro-active in fixing bugs and sends those patches upstream for the benefit of everyone who uses WordPress.</p>\n<p>Out of all the companies represented on the panel, Bluehost is the only one that works exclusively with Automattic and the WordPress project. They also have two employees who work full time contributing to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Site 5 attends and sponsors as many WordCamps as they can. Site 5 helps users get a grasp of WordPress and solving customer problems is their way of contributing to the larger WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s The Biggest Challenges Facing WordPress Specific Hosting Companies?</h3>\n<p>So many hosting companies advertise their support of WordPress, that Vasile of InMotion hosting says you need to specify that you can run WordPress on your servers or else customers don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n<p>One of the largest challenges in WordPress hosting is struggling to host customers who fail to keep WordPress and their site up to date and secure. Auto updates for security and bug fixes have been a big help in keeping sites secure.</p>\n<h3>What Is The Most Common Support Issue?</h3>\n<p>InMotion hosting sees a bit of everything. Sometimes the security measures put in place to protect users such as mod_security can cause problems.</p>\n<p>Site 5 has a lot of support requests that are high level due to their customer base. A lot of customers are the developer/designer type. They don&#8217;t have many customers who ask basic questions.</p>\n<p>Bluehost sees a lot of support requests due to plugins and themes if they negatively affect the performance of their customer&#8217;s sites.</p>\n<h3>Questions I Would Have Asked</h3>\n<p>Although I submitted a few questions to the panel, none were asked. In the hopes that these individuals will stop by and answer them in the comments, here are the questions I submitted to the show.</p>\n<p><strong>To the panel</strong>: Have you made any strategic deals with WordPress product and service companies in order to offer your customers more than just a hosting account?</p>\n<p><strong>To Bluehost</strong>: How beneficial has it been for the company to be <a title="http://wordpress.org/hosting/" href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/">one of the recommended webhosts</a> on WordPress.org? A follow up question would ask them to explain how they ended up in that position.</p>\n<p><strong>To the panel</strong>: How are they differentiating themselves from each other considering almost every webhost has the capability to host a WordPress site?</p>\n<h3>Watch The Entire Interview and Tell Us What You Think</h3>\n<p>The hosts of WPBacon, Robert Neu and Ozzy Rodriguez announced they will be hosting a WordPress Managed Hosting roundtable in the near future. Since the market has a lot of choices between shared and managed WordPress hosting, the duo decided to host two seperate roundtables.</p>\n<p>If you need help choosing the right webhost, <a title="http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site" href="http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site">consider these 14 things</a> before you make your decision.</p>\n<p>Watch the interview and let us know what you think in the comments.

I&#8217;m constantly reminded of the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule of software development</a> where 20% of the software is not used. I&#8217;ve noticed I rarely visit some of the links and menus in the backend of WordPress but there is no easy way to remove them from view.</p>\n<p><a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/adminimize/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/adminimize/">Adminimize</a> by <a title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/bueltge/" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/bueltge/">Frank Bültge</a> and <a title="http://inpsyde.com/en/" href="http://inpsyde.com/en/">Inpsyde GmbH </a>makes it easy to remove items from view based on a user&#8217;s role.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22537" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AdminimizeRoles.png" rel="prettyphoto[22504]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22537" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AdminimizeRoles.png?resize=1025%2C269" alt="User Roles Support In Adminimize" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">User Roles Support In Adminimize</p></div>\n<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice on the settings page is the large number of check boxes. The check boxes correspond to the default and custom user roles on the site. On this page, you can control which users see which parts of the WordPress backend. The options are split up into sections and are easily accessible from the top mini menu.</p>\n<p>After toying around with the settings, I was able to remove items from view I don&#8217;t use very often. The result was a simpler user interface that contained fewer things to look at. If you&#8217;re curious, here is what I removed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contextual help</li>\n<li>The about menu</li>\n<li>The add new menu within the admin bar</li>\n<li>The username and search box on the right hand side of the admin bar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where this plugin really shines is the options it provides to hide things from users based on their user role. While WordPress naturally hides things from view <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities">based on a user&#8217;s role</a>, this plugin can override the capabilities assigned to the role, providing more fine grain control. It&#8217;s not just tied to WordPress either, bbPress and WordPress multisite are supported as well.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22538" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AdminimizeImportExport.png" rel="prettyphoto[22504]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22538" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AdminimizeImportExport.png?resize=468%2C361" alt="Import Export Of Options" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Import Export Of Options</p></div>\n<p>Depending on the level of control you&#8217;re exerting, configuring the display options can be an exhaustive chore. Thankfully, Adminimize contains an import/export system so you don&#8217;t have to start over from scratch. The files are saved using the <a title="http://filext.com/file-extension/SEQ" href="http://filext.com/file-extension/SEQ">.SEQ file extension</a>. This makes it easy to transport settings from one WordPress site to another.</p>\n<p>If you decide to deactivate and uninstall the plugin, the database entries will not be removed. In order to completely remove the plugin from your site, you&#8217;ll need to check the <strong>Delete Options</strong> box.</p>\n<h3>Perfect For Consultants Handing Off Sites To Clients</h3>\n<p>One of the core philosophies of WordPress development is decisions, not options. In a similar fashion, Adminimize enables consultants to decide whether or not clients should have access to specific parts of the WordPress backend. Crippling the backend is not a good way for clients to learn WordPress but at the same time, I understand how limiting access could help prevent clients from breaking their sites.</p>\n<h3>The Adminimize Experiment</h3>\n<p>As a fun experiment, I encourage everyone to try out Adminimize and remove the sections of the dashboard you don&#8217;t often use. Then, take a screenshot of the user interface and submit the link in the comments. I&#8217;m curious to see which parts of the backend are the most common to be hidden and how the overall interface looks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 May 2014 22:51:13

href="http://addtohome.cubiq.org/" target="_blank">Add to Homescreen</a> is an open source project, developed by <a href="http://cubiq.org/" target="_blank">Matteo Spinelli</a>, that allows website owners to include the add to home screen call-out for mobile devices. The Javascript plugin is self-contained, dependency-free, and often recommended. Spinelli has just released an <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/official-add-to-homescreen/" target="_blank">official WordPress plugin</a> that will guide users through the complicated task of configuring the script.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed and configured, it will open an always-on-top message inviting mobile users to add the application to the home screen, a feature currently only available on iOS and Mobile Chrome browsers. Spinelli explains that &#8220;While other devices have the ability to bookmark any website to the home screen, only iOS and Mobile Chrome have a straightforward way to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Add to Homescreen plugin includes both basic and advanced configuration options, debugging, and statistics for how often your site is added to users&#8217; homescreens:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-to-homescreen-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[22511]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-to-homescreen-settings.png?resize=927%2C841" alt="add-to-homescreen-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22514" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s basic configuration page includes four presets for you to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anonymous</strong> &#8211; Displays the message but never tracks the users</li>\n<li><strong>Display Once</strong> &#8211; Displays the callout only once and tracks when added</li>\n<li><strong>Always Show</strong> &#8211; Displays the callout once every 24 hours until the user has added the website to the homescreen</li>\n<li><strong>Silent</strong> &#8211; Never show the callout but track when users add the application to the homescreen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The built-in stats feature allows you to keep track of the number of views vs. added to the homescreen:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-to-homescreen-stats.png" rel="prettyphoto[22511]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-to-homescreen-stats.png?resize=926%2C497" alt="add-to-homescreen-stats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22515" /></a></p>\n<p>Stats are a nice option, but if you have conflicts with other plugins, it might serve you better to disable it. Spinelli advises that the Anonymous option is the only 100% fail-safe solution if you are having trouble.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes the ability to upload a custom application icon, so you can brand it to your website accordingly. Spinelli plans to continue developing the plugin and is currently working on adding Windows Phone support to a future release.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/official-add-to-homescreen/" target="_blank">Official Add to Homescreen</a> plugin is considered official because it is developed by the same author of the popular <a href="http://addtohome.cubiq.org/" target="_blank">Javascript widget</a>. If you are already using this script or another plugin that uses it, your best option is to switch to the official plugin in order to stay up to date and receive the latest bug fixes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 May 2014 17:29:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: 5 Free Plugins for Hosting a Giveaway on Your WordPress Site";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=22338";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:184:"http://wptavern.com/5-free-plugins-for-hosting-a-giveaway-on-your-wordpress-site?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=5-free-plugins-for-hosting-a-giveaway-on-your-wordpress-site";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7525:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/giveaway.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/giveaway.jpg?resize=1019%2C477" alt="giveaway" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22494" /></a></p>\n<p>Hosting a giveaway is a popular way to introduce a new product or service on your website. When properly promoted, a giveaway can bring you an influx of new readers, traffic and can boost participation on your existing content. Other than using a 3rd party randomizer of some kind, there&#8217;s no easy way to do it in WordPress without a plugin. Not all giveaways are structured the same, so we&#8217;ve selected five unique plugins that make it easy to set up a giveaway on your WordPress site.</p>\n<h3>WP Giveaways</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp-giveaways.png" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp-giveaways.png?resize=1025%2C471" alt="wp-giveaways" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22476" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-giveaways/" target="_blank">WP Giveaways</a> is one of the most comprehensive plugins for selecting a winner from your WordPress users. It makes it possible for you to select a random winner(s) from a pool of subscribers or any role you select. The plugin allows you to host multiple giveaways and each will have a unique shortcode that will display the date of the next scheduled draw. WP Giveaways features the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a custom email template used to email the prize</li>\n<li>Attach files or simply email out the links to the prize(s)</li>\n<li>Each giveaway can be set as a recurring giveaway or a onetime deal</li>\n<li>Limit the contestant pool to the subscribers that registered since the giveaway was initially published</li>\n<li>View the history for each of the giveaways in terms of draw dates and the associated winners</li>\n<li>Choose how many winners to announce for each giveaway</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The handy thing about WP Giveaways is that it is totally automated. Once you schedule your giveaway, there is nothing else you have to do. The plugin utilizes WP Cron to schedule the draw and will automatically email the winner using the alert template that you create.</p>\n<h3>Give It Away Now</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/give-it-away-now.png" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/give-it-away-now.png?resize=627%2C331" alt="give-it-away-now" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22478" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/give-it-away-now/" target="_blank">Give It Away Now</a> is a relatively new plugin that is specifically for creating daily giveaways. Users can only enter once per day and the results are available in the admin settings page. Giveaways are created as a new content type with a featured image and the following fields: Why, About, Rules, Number of Prizes and End Date. This is how the new content type appears on the frontend:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/screenshot-1.png" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/screenshot-1.png?resize=776%2C680" alt="screenshot-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22481" /></a></p>\n<p>The post will automatically indicate when the giveaway has closed and all published giveaways will appear in their own archive. The Give It Away Now plugin is useful if you are hosting giveaways that last only 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Meetup Winner</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/winner.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/winner.jpg?resize=720%2C553" alt="winner" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22485" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/meetup-winner/" target="_blank">Meetup Winner</a> is a plugin that allows you to host a giveaway at your local meetup. It integrates with the Meetup.com API to select a random member of your Meetup who RSVPed to your event. You can then give away swag or prizes at the event.</p>\n<p>The Meetup Winner plugin is very easy to use. Simply add your API key in the settings, add your shortcode with the event&#8217;s ID to a page, and the winner will be shown on the frontend of the page.</p>\n<h3>Pick Giveaway Winner</h3>\n<p>If you want to select a winner based on comments on a post, the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pick-giveaway-winner/" target="_blank">Pick Giveaway Winner</a> plugin will do the trick. Its configuration page is found under the Tools menu.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pick-winner.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pick-winner.jpg?resize=794%2C348" alt="pick-winner" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22487" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin uses  MySQL&#8217;s random function RAND() to randomly select the winners directly from the database. When selecting a winner, you have the option to disqualify entrants who have submitted multiple entries, allow multiple entries, or disqualify multiple entries and allow only one to count. Pick Giveaway Winner hasn&#8217;t been updated in awhile, but I tested it with WordPress 3.9 and had no issues.</p>\n<h3>Golden Ticket</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/golden-ticket.png" rel="prettyphoto[22338]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/golden-ticket.png?resize=772%2C250" alt="golden-ticket" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22489" /></a></p>\n<p>The idea behind the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/golden-ticket/" target="_blank">Golden Ticket</a> plugin is to incentive interaction on your WordPress site. Essentially, the golden ticket is like a prize the user has to hunt for in order to win the reward. You can create multiple golden tickets and hide them throughout your content using a simple [ goldenticket ] shortcode. The golden ticket will pop into view after triggered by an action, which you can define in the settings.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>There are three available triggers for revealing the ticket:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>After a set amount of time:</strong> If you want to reward only the most loyal of readers, set the delay to something like 30 seconds. If they are still reading your content after 30 seconds, odds are they will read the ticket when it appears.</li>\n<li><strong>When the mouse is over the ticket:</strong> The ticket will remain invisible until the user hovers over it with the mouse. This is for those readers who scan through the content with their mouse cursor.</li>\n<li><strong>When the ticket is scrolled into view:</strong> The ticket will remain hidden on the page until the position of the ticket is scrolled into view. This means if you hide the ticket near the end of the content, it will never show until the user scrolls to that point.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Golden Ticket plugin offers a nice way to identify readers who interact with your content and reward them accordingly. It&#8217;s not your traditional giveaway plugin, but it&#8217;s likley more accurate at rewarding those who are truly interested in your content, instead of randomly selecting from visitors who are only interested in the prize.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 May 2014 22:25:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: New wptheory Service Launches WordPress Websites in a Day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=22402";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:178:"http://wptavern.com/new-wptheory-service-launches-wordpress-websites-in-a-day?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-wptheory-service-launches-wordpress-websites-in-a-day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5606:"<p>Adam Clark, founder of <a href="http://bottlerocketcreative.com/" target="_blank">Bottlerocket Creative</a>, just launched a new WordPress service that churns out a website in one day.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right, a complete website in a single day, for $999.</p>\n<p>This new project is called <a href="http://wptheory.net/" target="_blank">wptheory</a> and the service claims to be be able to customize and launch a WordPress theme in a scheduled workday beginning with an 8 a.m. discussion and culminating in a 6 p.m. launch party.

He&#8217;s hoping that packaging the services as products will be a successful business model.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to productize my development services, but could never figure out a good way to do it,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;The idea came from a friend of mine, <a href="http://andrewramos.com" target="_blank">Andrew Ramos</a>, who has a productized design service called <a href="http://appediem.com/" target="_blank">Appe Diem</a>, where he designs your iPhone app in a day.&#8221; Clark brainstormed with him about a developer equivalent to that kind of service and landed upon the WordPress theme customization idea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt like I could provide a lot of value to customers by offering a service that customized their theme, uploaded all their content and launched the site in a single day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Clark is launching wptheory alone but is open to adding a team if there is a demand for the service. He believes that this specific theme customization service is the first of its kind but isn&#8217;t sure whether it will take off. &#8220;Theme customization is a service that a lot of companies offer, but I haven’t seen anything exclusively devoted to this one service,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;And definitely no one doing it in a single day.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Selling Peace of Mind and Convenience</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no shortage of developers capable of customizing WordPress themes, but Clark is hoping that his new service will offer customers a tidy, branded package of WordPress convenience.</p>\n<blockquote><p>wptheory provides more than just theme customization. It’s an end-to-end website launching service that includes theme customization, content setup and hosting setup. It’s designed to take your mind off your website and let you focus on running your business. A customer shows up at 8 a.m. with their theme and they have a fully-functioning, customized website that is live on the internet by the end of the day. I don’t know anyone who is doing that. My hope is that customers will find a lot of value in the tailored service we offer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clark&#8217;s target market is people who don&#8217;t have a budget for a full custom design and development package and customers who are looking to get a site up fast.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe you have an idea for a product or service and you want a way to quickly validate the idea, but don’t want to spend a ton of cash or invest a lot of time in getting a site up,&#8221; he ventured in an example scenario. &#8220;There are a lot companies you could go to, but none that I think would provide wptheory’s level of quality and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>wptheory is aimed squarely at those who would be anxious at the prospect of creating their own websites. Clark summarizes his intentions with the new service:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mostly, I want to provide a lot of peace of mind. Launching a website is a complicated task for non-web-geeks. There are a lot of best practices to be aware of and I want to take all of that off your plate (even your hosting setup) and provide you with a beautiful, usable website before dinnertime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is important to note that wptheory&#8217;s basic package does not include custom development or structural changes to the chosen WordPress theme or plugins, although Clark does offer those services for an additional fee.  The advantage for the developer in this kind of arrangement is that it clearly defines and limits the scope of the project. It also keeps the client interaction happening within one day and not spread out over many days&#8217; worth of emails.</p>\n<p>One challenge Clark may face is that this service depends heavily on the client already having all the content ready to launch a website in a day. Even the most well-prepared clients are often clueless as to what this will entail, especially those that fall within his targeted &#8220;non-web-geek&#8221; demographic.</p>\n<p>For someone with a thriving WordPress development business, the venture isn&#8217;t all that much of a risk, given that it might as well be a natural extension of the services he already offers. But is there a market for websites launched in a day, just before dinnertime? Does <a href="http://wptheory.net/" target="_blank">wptheory</a> have a viable business model?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 May 2014 18:47:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WordPress.tv: Miro Veselý: Ako si zjednodušiť tvorbu webov a ako ich zmeniť na zisk?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=34574";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/06/miro-vesely-ako-si-zjednodusit-tvorbu-webov-a-ako-ich-zmenit-na-zisk/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:726:"<div id="v-yenxWqgv-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/34574/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/34574/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=34574&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/06/miro-vesely-ako-si-zjednodusit-tvorbu-webov-a-ako-ich-zmenit-na-zisk/"><img alt="Miro Veselý: Ako si zjednodušiť tvorbu webov a ako ich zmeniť na zisk?" src="http://videos.videopress.com/yenxWqgv/video-ebf504f5f3_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 May 2014 09:18:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WordPress.tv: Mathieu Viet : Prototypez vos applications avec WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=34552";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/06/mathieu-viet-prototypez-vos-applications-avec-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:677:"<div id="v-0qYuEY4u-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/34552/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/34552/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=34552&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/06/mathieu-viet-prototypez-vos-applications-avec-wordpress/"><img alt="14 &#8211;

Sessions ranged from <a title="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-511220" href="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-511220">Plugins 101</a> to the <a title="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-522042" href="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-522042">Science Of Design</a>. I only attended two sessions throughout the day as I spent the majority of my time networking. The sessions I participated in only had about 10-12 attendees but that didn&#8217;t faze the speaker as they still delivered a great presentation.</p>\n<h3>Organizing The Second WordCamp Proved More Difficult Than The First</h3>\n<p>When I interviewed one of the primary organizers of the event Joe Rozsa, he said the event was difficult to put together despite it being the second event he&#8217;s organized. A large amount of ticket sales near the time of the event added complexity but the team was able to overcome the challenge and maintain a smooth running WordCamp.</p>\n<p>In the following interview, Rosza tells me how he was able to secure the venue on a college campus and the challenges he faced while organizing the event. He also gives some great advice to first time WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<div class="audio-shortcode-wrap"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WCNC2014FeaturedImage.png?resize=175%2C131" alt="WordCamp North Canton 2014 Featured Image" class="landscape thumbnail post-thumbnail audio-image" /><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Interview-With-Joe-Rozsa.mp3">http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Interview-With-Joe-Rozsa.mp3</a></div><div class="media-shortcode-extend"><div class="media-info audio-info"><ul class="media-meta"><li><span class="prep">Run Time</span> <span class="data">6:31</span></li><li><span class="prep">Artist</span> <span class="data">Jeff Chandler</span></li><li><span class="prep">File Name</span> <span class="data"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Interview-With-Joe-Rozsa.mp3">Interview-With-Joe-Rozsa.mp3</a></span></li><li><span class="prep">File Size</span> <span class="data">3.33 MB</span></li><li><span class="prep">File Type</span> <span class="data">MP3</span></li><li><span class="prep">Mime Type</span> <span class="data">audio/mpeg</span></li></ul></div><a class="media-info-toggle">Audio Info</a></div>\n<h3>There Is Room For Improvement</h3>\n<div id="attachment_22407" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MainSessionRoomWordCampCanton2014.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22365]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22407" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MainSessionRoomWordCampCanton2014.jpg?resize=800%2C597" alt="Main Session Room" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Main Session Room</p></div>\n<p>The room you see in the image above is the main session room. The front of room is where sessions were held while the tables in the back of the room were used for networking. Unfortunately during some of the sessions, there was a considerable amount of noise and chatter from the back of the room. Although some of the speakers didn&#8217;t mind, it felt rude to be talking and networking while a speaker was presenting.</p>\n<p>I mentioned this to Rozsa who told me the facility would not allow him to close and open the room as needed. Hopefully next year, the building will allow this room to be sectioned off to keep the networking room and the presentation rooms separate.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22408" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordCampNorthCanton2014Schedule.png" rel="prettyphoto[22365]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22408" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordCampNorthCanton2014Schedule.png?resize=834%2C307" alt="WordCamp North Canton 2014 Schedule" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordCamp North Canton 2014 Schedule</p></div>\n<p>This years event featured two tracks, one for users and developers. With under 200 attendees, I felt like having five sessions at the same time was too much. Some of the sessions I witnessed had under 10 people in the room while others were packed. I&#8217;d like to see the event scale back to three sessions at a time max. The event just doesn&#8217;t have the amount of attendees to justify five sessions at any given time.</p>\n<p>There were also three sessions dedicated to security during the day. I attended the third session by <a title="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-511208" href="http://2014.northcanton.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-511208">Joseph Herbrandson</a> of Sucuri and it seemed like folks were worn out by the topic. Herbrandson delivers his information in an energetic way but being the third security session of day lead attendees to check out other sessions. With fewer presentations going on at the same time, it will help prevent this scenario from happening.</p>\n<h3>Ermano&#8217;s Hits Another Home Run</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights for me was the lunch prepared by <a href="http://ermannospizza.com/">Ermannos pizza</a>. Their Margherita pizza was just as good as last years. There were also plenty of salad dishes and beverages on hand. Lunch was capped off by Ermannos&#8217; now famous WordCamp S&#8217;mores. WordCamp North Canton 2014 ended the day at a local hotel bar for the after party.</p>\n<h3>Looking Forward To Next Year</h3>\n<p>Overall, the event was a success albeit with a few things to work on for 2015. The sessions I attended were presented by people passionate about the subject they were talking about. Most of the people in the audience were either new to WordPress or had little to no development experience. When I asked some of the attendees who also attend my local WordPress meetup what they thought of the event, every one of them said <strong>it was worth every penny</strong> with big smiles on their faces.</p>\n<p>Joe Rozsa and his team of volunteer staff members are to be commended for a job well done. Thanks to everyone who helped put on a fantastic event in my back yard. As long as North Canton keeps holding a WordCamp, I&#8217;ll keep coming. Meanwhile, keep an eye on the official <a title="http://2014.columbus.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.columbus.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Columbus Ohio blog</a> for information on the third WordCamp to be held in Ohio this year.</p>\n\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/recap-of-wordcamp-north-canton-2014/attachment/712"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/712.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Plenty Of Salad Greens" /></a>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/recap-of-wordcamp-north-canton-2014/attachment/713"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/713.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Best Pizza In Town" /></a>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/recap-of-wordcamp-north-canton-2014/attachment/716"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/716.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Ermannos Famous S''mores" /></a>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/recap-of-wordcamp-north-canton-2014/attachment/715"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/715.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="WordCamp North Canton 2014" /></a>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 May 2014 03:03:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: Save Time Building WordPress Customizer Controls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=20157";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:160:"http://wptavern.com/save-time-building-wordpress-customizer-controls?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=save-time-building-wordpress-customizer-controls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4836:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/customizer-controls.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[20157]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/customizer-controls.jpg?resize=732%2C290" alt="customizer-controls" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22384" /></a></p>\n<p>Adding controls to WordPress&#8217; theme customizer can be somewhat tedious and there are <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/custom-controls-in-the-theme-customizer--wp-34556" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://ottopress.com/2012/making-a-custom-control-for-the-theme-customizer/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> dedicated to creating your own controls. <a href="https://github.com/paulund/Wordpress-Theme-Customizer-Custom-Controls" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Customizer Custom Controls</a> is a project on Github that provides a collection of ready-made controls that you can drop right into your theme. This set of extra controls was created by WordPress developer <a href="http://www.paulund.co.uk/" target="_blank">Paul Underwood</a>.</p>\n<p>The collection includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Category Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of all the categories on your WordPress theme</li>\n<li><strong>Date Picker</strong> &#8211; Adds a date picker control to the theme customizer</li>\n<li><strong>Layout Picker</strong> &#8211; Adds 3 images of layouts to the page for you to select a new style</li>\n<li><strong>Menu Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of all the menus on your WordPress site</li>\n<li><strong>Post Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of all the posts on your WordPress site</li>\n<li><strong>Tags Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of all tags on your WordPress site</li>\n<li><strong>Text Editor</strong> &#8211; Creates a textbox with the TinyMCE textarea</li>\n<li><strong>Textarea</strong> &#8211; Creates a textarea input field</li>\n<li><strong>Taxonomy Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of taxonomies ( Usage: see Gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/4538951" target="_blank">4538951</a> )</li>\n<li><strong>User List Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Creates a dropdown of users for a role ( Usage: see Gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/4564337" target="_blank">4564337</a> )</li>\n<li><strong>Google Fonts Dropdown</strong> &#8211; Create a dropdown to show you the 30 most popular fonts on Google web fonts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Use the WordPress Theme Customizer Custom Controls</h3>\n<p>If you want to use all of the custom controls in your theme, including them is very simple. Download the project from Github, unpack it and then drop the /wordpress-theme-customizer-custom-controls/ directory wherever you want within your theme&#8217;s structure, making sure to adjust the path below if you change it. Add this to your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">require_once ''/inc/wordpress-theme-customizer-custom-controls/theme-customizer-demo.php'';</pre>\n<p>This will put all of the custom controls into the customizer under a &#8220;Custom Controls Demo&#8221; item and will include WordPress&#8217; default controls under &#8220;Default Demo Controls:&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controls.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[20157]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controls.jpg?resize=578%2C458" alt="controls" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22393" /></a></p>\n<p>Ideally, you would adjust the controls to better suit your theme and add only the ones that work with the design. It provides a great starting place and an easy way to learn more about how the controls are created, should you want to add more of your own.</p>\n<p>The Taxonomy and User List dropdowns both require a bit of extra setup and the usage is demonstrated in the example gists for each. The Google Fonts Dropdown has built-in caching, which <a href="http://www.paulund.co.uk/cache-google-web-fonts-api" target="_blank">creates a cache file on the user&#8217;s machine</a> so that you don&#8217;t have to call the API so many times.</p>\n<p>Adding custom controls to the customizer is a great way to allow for more personalization in a theme created for a client or for public distribution. The user can easily change styles and preview them live, without having to make requests for design changes. Hopefully, the <a href="https://github.com/paulund/Wordpress-Theme-Customizer-Custom-Controls" target="_blank">Custom WordPress Customizer Controls</a> can save you a little time in building out your next theme.

The success of WordPress.com, Automattic&#8217;s flagship product, is part of the reason that number continues to rise steadily. WordPress.com makes it easy for anyone to create a WordPress site without the burden of setting up hosting to install the software.</p>\n<p>This morning Automattic&#8217;s founder, Matt Mullenweg, <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the company is raising $160M in new funding. After taking the helm as CEO <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-takes-on-new-role-as-ceo-of-automattic" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>, Mullenweg said that he set out on a 100-day plan to pursue new funding and find a set of partners who share Automattic&#8217;s vision of an open web.</p>\n<p>Although Automattic is healthy and growing, Mullenweg cites recent infrastructure and product investments as part of the reason the company will require more cash in order to continue its rapid growth.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Things were and are going well, but there was an opportunity cost to how we were managing the company toward break-even, and we realized we could invest more into WordPress and our products to grow faster.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the first time the company has raised money since 2008 when it pulled in $12 million. Automattic is now valued at $1.16 billion for this round of $160 million in new funding. <strong>&#8220;This is obviously a lot of money, especially considering everything we&#8217;ve done so far has been built on only about $12M of outside capital over the past 8 years,&#8221;</strong> Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>The new funding opens a window of opportunity for Automattic and enables the company to launch new products and hire more employees to support its rapid growth. Mullenweg, who is also the co-founder of the open source WordPress project, closes his announcement post with a reaffirmation of Automattic&#8217;s commitment to support the community behind WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe WordPress will win, first and foremost, because of its community — the hundreds of core developers and large commercial companies, the tens of thousands of plugin and theme developers, and the millions of people who build beautiful things with WordPress every day. Automattic is here to support that community and invest the full strength of our resources to making WordPress a better product every day, bringing us closer to our shared mission of democratizing publishing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With this round of fundraising finishing shortly, it&#8217;s clear that Automattic&#8217;s investors are ready to support its guiding mission, and they&#8217;re betting firmly on the community behind WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 May 2014 17:25:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: New Funding for Automattic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43810";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3237:"<p>I&#8217;ll start with the big stuff: <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> is raising $160M, all primary, and it&#8217;s the first investment into the company since 2008.

So part of my 100-day plan as CEO was to figure out what new funding could look like and we found a great set of partners who believe in our vision for how the web should be and how we can scale into the opportunity ahead of us, though it ended up taking 110 days until the first close. (Our other main areas of focus have been improving mobile, a new version of WP.com, and <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a>.)</p>\n<p>This Series C round was led by Deven Parekh of Insight Venture Partners, and included new investors Chris Sacca, Endurance, and a special vehicle True Ventures created to step up their investment, alongside our existing secondary investors from last year, Tiger and Iconiq. (There is a second close soon so this list might change a bit.) There was interest significantly above what we raised, but we focused in on finding the best partners and scaled it back to be the right amount of capital at the right valuation. Deven and Insight share our long term vision and are focused on building an enduring business, one that will thrive for decades to come.</p>\n<p>WordPress is in a market as competitive as it has ever been, especially on the proprietary and closed side. I believe WordPress will win, first and foremost, because of its community &#8212; the hundreds of core developers and large commercial companies, the tens of thousands of plugin and theme developers, and the millions of people who build beautiful things with WordPress every day. Automattic is here to support that community and invest the full strength of our resources to making WordPress a better product every day, bringing us closer to our shared mission of democratizing publishing. But a majority of the web isn&#8217;t on an open platform yet, and we have a lot of work ahead of us.

This was verified through the <a title="https://twitter.com/GoDaddyHelp" href="https://twitter.com/GoDaddyHelp">GoDaddy Help</a> twitter account.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mistical">@mistical</a> We did discontinue our email support. However, we do offer live chat now. It can be accessed here: <a href="http://t.co/HFw77fAJTh">http://t.co/HFw77fAJTh</a> ^KJ</p>\n<p>&mdash; GoDaddy Help (@GoDaddyHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoDaddyHelp/statuses/461695002520072192">May 1, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both support methods were removed in favor of live chat and phone support. I reached out to GoDaddy&#8217;s media representatives and asked why the options were removed and why they weren&#8217;t more forthcoming about the changes. Nick Fuller, a GoDaddy representative explained that email consistently finished last as far as their customers&#8217; preferred method of help.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After reviewing customer behavior and satisfaction scores we decided we could better serve people in ways they were telling us work better for them.</p>\n<p>Customers love the ‘real time’ support experience. Email is not instantaneous and in fact many in the industry are putting an end to their email service as well because fewer than half of tech customers believe their problem can be solved by email – it’s sort of going the way of the cassette tape.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former GoDaddy employee Brad Cook, was one of the first to <a title="http://www.clicknowmarketing.com/domains/godaddy-ends-email-support/" href="http://www.clicknowmarketing.com/domains/godaddy-ends-email-support/">report on the loss of email and ticket support</a>. Cook <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vosu4bTUJ4Y" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vosu4bTUJ4Y">documented his effort</a> in a YouTube video showing the drawbacks of the live support option. He ended up having to wait 1.5 hours for help. Unfortunately, his wait was for nothing, &#8220;I had to rush into the other room as my son was getting sick right around the time my turn in line came up and I ended up missing my opportunity to chat after this long wait.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Which Is A Quicker Means Of Support, Phone Or Live Chat?</h3>\n<p>On the afternoon of March 30th, I performed an experiment. I wanted to find out which method of support was quicker and whether or not the support representatives would try to upsell me on other services. I explained to both parties that I wanted to know when my domain was up for renewal.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone Support</strong>: The wait time on the phone was only nine minutes. Once on the line, the gentleman spoke English, was to the point, and politely asked how he could help. I asked when my domain was up for renewal. He told me the exact date while also explaining how I could find that information out myself via the GoDaddy control panel. He said they could renew it for me on the phone or I could do it myself. I chose to do it myself.</p>\n<p>He asked how else he could help and I told him that was the only question I had. He thanked me and said have a good day. <strong>At no point</strong> during the phone call did he try to sell me services such as webhosting to go with my domain. In fact, the experience was better than I expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat</strong>:</p>\n<p>I started the Live Chat session at the same time I called GoDaddy. As you can see from the image below, I had to <strong>wait 35 minutes</strong>. While Cook experienced inaccurate waiting times, I found mine to be relatively accurate.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22318" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GoDaddyLiveChat.png" rel="prettyphoto[22168]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22318" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GoDaddyLiveChat.png?resize=720%2C582" alt="GoDaddy Live Chat" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Waiting In A Virtual Line</p></div>\n<p>After waiting on the live chat for 10 minutes, I already had my problem solved via phone support. When I eventually got the chance to speak with a tech support representative, I was able to verify a couple of problems outlined by Cook.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no audible or visual cue that indicates it&#8217;s my turn to talk</li>\n<li>If the chat window is minimized, it doesn&#8217;t blink in the taskbar when a message has been received</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked the chat rep when my domain would need to be renewed. They responded in a few minutes with the correct answer and told me they could renew it for me, or I could do it manually. I told them I&#8217;d do it manually. I thanked the rep for helping me. After the usual <em>you&#8217;re welcome message</em>, my chat session was closed. <strong>At no point</strong> during the chat session did they try to sell me services such as webhosting to go with my domain.</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy Is Addressing Growing Pains With Live Chat</h3>\n<p>Phone support at GoDaddy was a superior experience compared to live chat. Because of the problems mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s too easy to miss your opportunity to chat with a representative. Once you&#8217;ve lost your chance, you have to go to the end of the line. I shared Cook&#8217;s post to GoDaddy and Fuller admits there is work to be done to improve the experience.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s work to be done and we’re just in the beginning phases of the transition. As of today, we’ve expanded our live chat support team by 20 representatives in order to better meet the demand in the general customer care chat. We’re also expanding the team for live chat support on the hosting side and we’re working with our live chat tool provider to provide an audio notification when a chat session is ready to go.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good thing GoDaddy has added more representatives to address demand because waiting for 30 minutes is unacceptable. I&#8217;ve used the live chat for HostGator and other service providers and the wait times have generally been under 10 minutes. Most of the time, I can reach someone without any wait at all.</p>\n<p>I prefer live chat over speaking with someone on the phone because it&#8217;s a more natural means of communication for me. It&#8217;s also easier to send URL&#8217;s through chat than over the phone. However, I&#8217;m glad that each support method didn&#8217;t try to upsell me on additional products and services. Such a practice during a time of need is slimy at best.</p>\n<h3>Aligning With Customer Needs</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gravitylogo.png" rel="prettyphoto[22168]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2322" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gravitylogo.png?resize=108%2C109" alt="gravityforms logo" /></a>I certainly don&#8217;t fault GoDaddy for doing away with email and ticket based support. Since their data supports the reasoning for getting rid of them, it makes sense. In mid 2013, <a title="http://www.gravityhelp.com/gravity-forms-standard-support-change-announcement/" href="http://www.gravityhelp.com/gravity-forms-standard-support-change-announcement/">GravityForms changed their standard support structure</a> to remove forums. The move was inspired by the explosive growth of their product and the forum had become unmanageable.</p>\n<p>I like support forums since they give me an opportunity to help myself but for successful companies, they can easily become unmanageable. But the move was made to <em>better serve the needs of their customers</em>.</p>\n<p>As a company, it makes sense to do whatever is best for the customer.

His <a href="https://foxnet-themes.fi/downloads/kultalusikka/" target="_blank">Kultalusikka</a> theme is the sales leader, with just 15 purchases. Keijonen has one theme for sale on WordPress.com, which was added in March of this year and has so far <a href="https://twitter.com/samikeijonen/status/461927487422095360" target="_blank">netted him $147.64</a>.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href="https://foxnet-themes.fi/experiment-commercial-theme-for-free/" target="_blank">post</a> that frankly details his disappointment with the sales, Keijonen announced a new theme experiment wherein he will be releasing some of his commercial themes on github, starting with his latest Mina Olen theme. This is the same theme that is available for sale on <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/mina-olen/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a> for $75 and on <a href="https://foxnet-themes.fi/downloads/mina-olen/" target="_blank">Foxnet</a> for 39.00€.</p>\n<p>Mina Olen is based on Justin Tadlock&#8217;s <a href="http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core" target="_blank">Hybrid Core</a>. All of its options can be found in WordPress&#8217; customizer. The theme includes support for many major plugins in order to provide additional functionality, including <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/" target="_blank">bbPress</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/" target="_blank">Custom Content Portfolio</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/testimonials-by-woothemes/" target="_blank">Testimonials</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-header-extended/" target="_blank">Custom Header Extended</a>, and more.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22232" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mina-olen.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22210]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mina-olen.jpg?resize=880%2C660" alt="Mina Olen WordPress Theme" class="size-full wp-image-22232" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mina Olen WordPress Theme</p></div>\n<p>Keijonen emphasizes that he is still referring to the theme as a commercial product, because he will not be offering support or automatic updates for free. Since it&#8217;s just an experiment, he retains the option to make the Github repo private at any time in the future.</p>\n<p>Keijonen is watching the results of the experiment to see if it affects the popularity of his theme, as well as the sales for support. He&#8217;s hoping that if people can test drive the theme before they make a decision, they will be more inclined to purchase support. &#8220;I can show off my code, it’s pretty solid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That way I can build more trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Having the theme&#8217;s code publicly available on Github will enable developers to contribute improvements to it. Mina Olen is one of his go-to themes that allows him to create custom child themes in no time, such as the <a href="http://tarkkanen.fi/" target="_blank">jewelry site</a> he recently launched. He&#8217;s hoping that people will be able to more easily use it in their projects, especially those who build on top of the Theme Hybrid framework.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/mina-olen/" target="_blank">live demo</a> for the theme shows all of the post formats in action, along with the many layouts and color schemes. If you want to participate in the experiment, you can <a href="https://github.com/samikeijonen/mina-olen" target="_blank">download the Mina Olen WordPress theme</a> for free from Github. Does access to the theme for free make you more inclined to pay for support or more likely to purchase another theme in Foxnet collection?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 May 2014 18:23:16

Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class="closed" title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811">#21811</a>).</li>\n<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631">#26631</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.9, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS!</strong> Hello! There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>).</li>\n<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">implementation ticket</a> for more.

Such an omission would seem more understandable if Melville hadn''t engaged the topic of patent medicine in other works from the 1850x.  In <em>The Confidence Man</em>, for example, Melville devotes several chapters to the dealings of an herb doctor who prescribes "Omni-Balsamic Reinvigorator" and "Samaritan Pain Dissuader" to passengers on a steamboat ironically name <em>Fidele</em>.  There, Stubb''s skepticism in the face of such medicine finds expression in the voice of a Missouri bachelor who derides one of the herb doctor''s patients: "Yarbs, yarbs; natur, natur; you foolish old file you!  He diddles you with that hocus-pocus, did he?  Yarbs and nature will cure your incurlable cough, you think" (NN <em>CM</em> 106).  Directly connecting the phenomenon of herbal medicine to the novel''s central conceit of the confidence game, Mellville even has the Missourian remark, "I have confidence in distrust; more particularly as applied to you and your herbs" (108).  Finally, in "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!" a story with references to steamboat and railroad disasters, a less skeptical but much more desperate narrator speaks of money as "a drug in the market," lamenting, "But blame me if I can get any of the drug, though there never was a sick man more in need of that particular sort of medicine" (NN <em>Plazza Tales Tales</em> 270).  Checking his pockets, the narrator then declares, "Ha! here''s a powder I was going to send the sick baby in yonder hovel, where the Irish ditcher lives."\r\n\r\nClearly, Melville is playing games with patent medicines in his fiction from the 1850s.  This essay seeks to answer the lawyer''s question in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- "Now, what was ginger?" -- as a way of trying to elucidate the scrivener''s mysterious rebellion, and it assumes from the outset that the lawyer cannot possibly answer his own question.  Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="ftp://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savarese--Nervous-Wrecks-and-Ginger-nuts.pdf">"Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts" (PDF)</a>', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts: Bartleby at Standstill', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '609-revision-5', '', '', '2010-09-27 19:41:07', '2010-09-28 02:41:07', '', 609, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/609-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Is ginger the sort of fuel you use . . . to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? . . . The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward and apothecary, sir? . . . We''ll teach you how to drug a harpooner, none of your apothecary''s medicine here.</blockquote>\n\nNow recall the moment in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" when the lawyer meditates on Bartleby''s peculiar eating habits:\n\n<blockquote>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I: never eats a dinner, properly speaking . . . My mind ran on in reveries concerning the probably effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts . . . Now, what was ginger"</blockquote>\n\nDespite the nearly seven hundred essays on Mellville''s famous story, this striking parallel has remained untreated.  Such an omission would seem more understandable if Melville hadn''t engaged the topic of patent medicine in other works from the 1850x.  In <em>The Confidence Man</em>, for example, Melville devotes several chapters to the dealings of an herb doctor who prescribes "Omni-Balsamic Reinvigorator" and "Samaritan Pain Dissuader" to passengers on a steamboat ironically name <em>Fidele</em>.  There, Stubb''s skepticism in the face of such medicine finds expression in the voice of a Missouri bachelor who derides one of the herb doctor''s patients: "Yarbs, yarbs; natur, natur; you foolish old file you!  He diddles you with that hocus-pocus, did he?  Yarbs and nature will cure your incurlable cough, you think" (NN <em>CM</em> 106).  Directly connecting the phenomenon of herbal medicine to the novel''s central conceit of the confidence game, Mellville even has the Missourian remark, "I have confidence in distrust; more particularly as applied to you and your herbs" (108).  Finally, in "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!" a story with references to steamboat and railroad disasters, a less skeptical but much more desperate narrator speaks of money as "a drug in the market," lamenting, "But blame me if I can get any of the drug, though there never was a sick man more in need of that particular sort of medicine" (NN <em>Plazza Tales Tales</em> 270).  Checking his pockets, the narrator then declares, "Ha! here''s a powder I was going to send the sick baby in yonder hovel, where the Irish ditcher lives."\n\nClearly, Melville is playing games with patent medicines in his fiction from the 1850s.  This essay seeks to answer the lawyer''s question in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- "Now, what was ginger?" -- as a way of trying to elucidate the scrivener''s mysterious rebellion, and it assumes from the outset that the lawyer cannot possibly answer his own question.  Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\n\nRead the rest of <a href=""Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts"', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '609-autosave', '', '', '2010-09-17 12:32:57', '2010-09-17 19:32:57', '', 609, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/609-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

"Sad Dear Saved Me"</h3>\r\n\r\n"Hours of light like heat hibernate/great icebergs hear the cries of hurt." So, my son, adopted at the age of six from foster care, began a poem entitled, "Alaska." Written on a communcation device in the fifth grade, it establishes a number of exquisite analogies--between light and bears and calving icebergs and "hurt" people. By "hurt" people he means kids such as himself who were abandoned by their parents, kids with disabilities forced to survive in a land of unremitting darkness.\r\n\r\nThat darkness included the worst sort of physical and sexual abuse and you can see him find in the natural setting of Alaska the unlit bedroom in which the abuse took place.  Indeed, you can see him find the saga of his entire early life: separation from his parents and sister, then frigid loneliness and injury--the two compressed into an image that does not behave, as my sentence just did, chronologically.  The awful calving refers <em>both</em> to the loss of family and to the physical experience of rape, of being split open, as my son explained almost too matter-of-factly.  At once inarticulate and faintly human, the sound of that calving seems an apt correlative for the cry of childhood trauma--especially apt in the case of a boy who literally cannot speak and who, back then, had no way of communicating what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nAs Alaska waits in winter for warmth it can barely imagine coming, so my son waited for relief from his attacker and, even less probably, for parents who might love him. "yes. dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes." he typed recently on his talking computer.  We had been conversing about the past--in particular, my decision not to have kids and my own experience of depression.  And there he was the voice of triumphant spring, in all of its freshness, reminding me to be hopeful.

It was a reasonable question in this age of narrow self-concern — far more reasonable, or at least more reasonably put, than many of the other questions we fielded.\r\n\r\nFor example, "Why don''t you have your own children?" a wealthy relative inquired, as if natural family-making were a kind of gated community it was best never to abandon. "You two have such good genes," she added. "Why waste them?"\r\n\r\nA colleague at work confronted me in the mailroom with this memorable gem: "Have you tried in-vitro?" She feared that we hadn''t availed ourselves of the many wondrous technologies that rescue infertile couples. "Wouldn''t that be better than adopting a child with a disability?" she asked, drawing out the word "disability." "God knows what that kid''s parents were doing when they conceived him."\r\n\r\n"We''re not infertile," I barked. "We have a relationship with the boy."\r\n\r\nMy wife, an autism expert, had offered his mother services, but as the woman found it increasingly difficult to care for her son and then dropped out of the picture altogether, we''d started spending time with him. His first communicative act with language, at age 3 — the sign for "more" — we''d taught him while tickling his belly.\r\n\r\nHe later made that sign in the emergency room of a hospital where he was brought after being beaten in foster care. Upon seeing us — we''d been called in to try to calm him — he stopped in his tracks, paused (as if to allow some associative chain to complete itself) and demanded obsessively to be tickled. I remember searching on his chest for unbruised patches among the purple, blue and black. He was that frantic in his quest for the familiar and, dare I say, for love.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I can''t believe how callous people were; the strange anxiety that adopting a child with a disability provoked. And the anxiety just kept coming. "Healthy white infants must be tough to get," a neighbor commented. No paragons of racial sensitivity, we were nevertheless appalled by the idea that we''d do anything to avoid adopting, say, a black child or a Latino one.\r\n\r\nAs offensive was the assumption that we must be devout Christians: hyperbolic, designated do-gooders with a joint eye firmly on some final prize. "God''s reserving a special place for you," we heard on more than one occasion, as if our son deserved pity and we were allowed neither our flaws nor a different understanding of social commitment. The journalist Adam Pertman, in his otherwise excellent book, "Adoption Nation," reproduces this logic exactly when he speaks of "children so challenging that only the most saintly among us would think [my italics] of tackling their behavioral and physical problems."\r\n\r\nDespite the stigma attached to "special-needs children," people do adopt these kids. And yet, many more Americans spend gobs of money on fertility treatments or travel to foreign countries to find their perfect little bundles. I''m haunted by something my son wrote after we taught him how to read and type on a computer: "I want you to be proud of me. I dream of that because in foster care I had no one." How many kids lie in bed at night and think something similar?\r\n\r\nThe physical and behavioral problems have been significant, at times even crushing. The last eight years have been devoted almost exclusively to my son''s welfare: literacy training, occupational therapy, relationship building, counseling for post-traumatic stress — the list goes on and on. But what strides he has made.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was still in diapers and said to be retarded when he came to live with us is now a straight-A student at our local middle school. He''s literally rewriting the common scripts of autism and "attachment disorder" (the broad diagnosis for the problems of abandoned and traumatized kids). These are hopeless scripts, unforgiving scripts in which the child can''t give back.\r\n\r\nMy son does, and others can as well.

Is ginger the sort of fuel you use . . . to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? . . . The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward and apothecary, sir? . . . We''ll teach you how to drug a harpooner, none of your apothecary''s medicine here.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow recall the moment in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" when the lawyer meditates on Bartleby''s peculiar eating habits:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I: never eats a dinner, properly speaking . . . My mind ran on in reveries concerning the probably effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts . . . Now, what was ginger"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDespite the nearly seven hundred essays on Mellville''s famous story, this striking parallel has remained untreated.  Such an omission would seem more understandable if Melville hadn''t engaged the topic of patent medicine in other works from the 1850x.  In <em>The Confidence Man</em>, for example, Melville devotes several chapters to the dealings of an herb doctor who prescribes "Omni-Balsamic Reinvigorator" and "Samaritan Pain Dissuader" to passengers on a steamboat ironically name <em>Fidele</em>.  There, Stubb''s skepticism in the face of such medicine finds expression in the voice of a Missouri bachelor who derides one of the herb doctor''s patients: "Yarbs, yarbs; natur, natur; you foolish old file you!  He diddles you with that hocus-pocus, did he?  Yarbs and nature will cure your incurlable cough, you think" (NN <em>CM</em> 106).  Directly connecting the phenomenon of herbal medicine to the novel''s central conceit of the confidence game, Mellville even has the Missourian remark, "I have confidence in distrust; more particularly as applied to you and your herbs" (108).  Finally, in "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!" a story with references to steamboat and railroad disasters, a less skeptical but much more desperate narrator speaks of money as "a drug in the market," lamenting, "But blame me if I can get any of the drug, though there never was a sick man more in need of that particular sort of medicine" (NN <em>Plazza Tales Tales</em> 270).  Checking his pockets, the narrator then declares, "Ha! here''s a powder I was going to send the sick baby in yonder hovel, where the Irish ditcher lives."\r\n\r\nClearly, Melville is playing games with patent medicines in his fiction from the 1850s.  This essay seeks to answer the lawyer''s question in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- "Now, what was ginger?" -- as a way of trying to elucidate the scrivener''s mysterious rebellion, and it assumes from the outset that the lawyer cannot possibly answer his own question.  Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="ftp://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savarese--Nervous-Wrecks-and-Ginger-nuts.pdf">"Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts" (PDF)</a>', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '609-revision-4', '', '', '2010-09-20 12:44:07', '2010-09-20 19:44:07', '', 609, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/609-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

"Sad Dear Saved Me"</h3>\r\n\r\n"Hours of light like heat hibernate/great icebergs hear the cries of hurt." So, my son, adopted at the age of six from foster care, began a poem entitled, "Alaska." Written on a communcation device in the fifth grade, it establishes a number of exquisite analogies--between light and bears and calving icebergs and "hurt" people. By "hurt" people he means kids such as himself who were abandoned by their parents, kids with disabilities forced to survive in a land of unremitting darkness.\r\n\r\nThat darkness included the worst sort of physical and sexual abuse and you can see him find in the natural setting of Alaska the unlit bedroom in which the abuse took place.  Indeed, you can see him find the saga of his entire early life: separation from his parents and sister, then frigid loneliness and injury--the two compressed into an image that does not behave, as my sentence just did, chronologically.  The awful calving refers <em>both</em> to the loss of family and to the physical experience of rape, of being split open, as my son explained almost too matter-of-factly.  At once inarticulate and faintly human, the sound of that calving seems an apt correlative for the cry of childhood trauma--especially apt in the case of a boy who literally cannot speak and who, back then, had no way of communicating what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nAs Alaska waits in winter for warmth it can barely imagine coming, so my son waited for relief from his attacker and, even less probably, for parents who might love him. "yes. dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes." he typed recently on his talking computer.  We had been conversing about the past--in particular, my decision not to have kids and my own experience of depression.  And there he was the voice of triumphant spring, in all of its freshness, reminding me to be hopeful. Remind me in that language, that poetry, I have come to think of as "Autie-type."\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="http://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savares--The-Lobes-of-Autobiography.pdf">"The Lobes of Autobiography: Poetry and Autism" (PDF)</a>\r\n', 'The Lobes of Autobiography: Poetry and Autism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '595-revision-7', '', '', '2010-09-27 19:40:07', '2010-09-28 02:40:07', '', 595, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/595-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

With John Proctor raging against the trial that would convict him of witchcraft, Judge Danforth was supposed to exclaim, "Do you doubt my probity?"

Still “embodiment” can represent something more than the site of the psyche’s “agon” — more than the psyche, for that matter. We must conceive of distributed intelligence, what the American poet Charles Olson called proprioception, the body’s understanding of itself in space. Lyric space, lyric relation. Corporeal knowing. Robert Creeley echoes this idea, repeating famously: “The plan is the body / the plan is the body . . . ” In effect, the difficulties stemming from our physical lives are the incitements of wisdom. We have long understood this notion in the context of aging. Kings Solomon and David are said to have grown virtuous on account of their advanced ages. The French say: “Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse pouvait!” If you’re lucky enough to grow old and infirm you may possess some virtues.\r\n\r\nWhat about the bodies that must struggle daily with the body politic? If Crazy Jane is correct, bodies at all ages know something, something we understand as an admixture of sublimations, faiths, despairs, and determinations. There are secrets to the arts of the body and its accentuations are odd. One thinks of the Tao’s “Ecclesiastes”:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There is a time for being ahead,\r\na time for being behind;\r\na time for being in motion;\r\na time for being at rest;\r\na time for being vigorous;\r\na time for being exhausted;\r\na time for being safe;\r\na time for being in danger.\r\n\r\nThe Master sees things as they are,\r\nwithout trying to control them.\r\nShe lets them go their own way,\r\nand resides at the center of the circle.</blockquote>\r\n— <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, Stephen Mitchell translation\r\n\r\nOne may usefully think of the Master as full embodiment, or in Jungian terms as individuation. What the body “knows” must be seen relative to things as they are and not suborned into easy stories of overcoming — the body knows it is all things at once. That this may be seen as a lyric intelligence is surely sensible. The lyric is fractious, ideogrammatic, uncensored, naive and wise, and it proposes that we carry through our lives as well as we can, that we absorb errors, that certain ideals may be undone, that we may get to knowledge by indirection. Embodiment in literary terms is not far from analytical psychology save for this distinction: writers who sense the body’s ways of knowing are not interested in the closures of self-help narratives.

Parents endure the stress of making tenure with the demands of life with children. While women’s careers are derailed more often than men’s as a result of such competing pressures, fathers, too, experience conflicting feelings about work and home, making parenting ever more challenging.\r\n\r\nIn Papa, PhD, Mary Ruth Marotte, Paige Martin Reynolds, and Ralph James Savarese bring together a group contributors from a variety of  backgrounds and disciplines. They are white, black, South Asian, Asian, and Arab. They are gay and straight, married and divorced. They are tenured and untenured, at research-one universities and at community colleges. Some write at the beginning of their careers, others at the end.  Perhaps most important, they do not look back—they look forward to new parental and professional synergies as they reflect on what it means to be a father in the academy.\r\n\r\nThe fathers writing in Papa, PhD seek to expand their children’s horizons, giving them the gifts of better topic sentences and a cosmopolitan sensibility. They seriously consider the implications of gender theory and queer theory—even Marxist theory—and make relevant theoretical connections between their work and the less abstract, more pragmatic, world of fathering. What resonates is the astonishing range of forms that fatherhood can take as these dads challenge traditional norms by actively questioning the status quo.', 'Papa, PhD', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'papa-phd', '', '', '2010-09-27 20:07:08', '2010-09-28 03:07:08', '', 0, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/', 0, 'page', '', 0);

Just as people with physical disabilities have insisted on the right to self-representation and determination, so, too, have people with autism — and not just those who are termed "high-functioning." As it advances a notion of “a complicated, ambiguous impairment,” the special issue tries hard to embody the principle of self-representation. Half of the nearly forty contributors are on the autism spectrum; any number of them carries the label of "severely autistic." Some do not speak, or speak in a limited way, and instead type or write to communicate. The work of these contributors appears in every section of the special issue: refereed articles, cultural commentaries, reviews, interviews, and roundtables.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about autism, let us dispense with rigid binaries: <em>either</em> difference <em>or</em> disability.  As Phil Schwarz argues, “The mainstream speaks of autism primarily in the medical language of deficit, and cannot see, as many of us on the spectrum do, that once the right kinds of support, accommodation, and mitigation of specific handicaps are available, there are desirable aspects to autism that we would not want to live without.” Or as Tito Mukhopadhyay puts it:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So what if a Theory\r\nSays something\r\nIt doesn''t change for sure\r\nAny — Thing.\r\nI may be that\r\nAnd I may be this...\r\nWho Cares anyway?\r\nI am a Proud Autistic.</blockquote>', 'Autism and the Concept of Neurodiversity', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'autism-and-the-concept-of-neurodiversity', '', '', '2010-09-27 20:11:25', '2010-09-28 03:11:25', '', 0, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/', 0, 'page', '', 0);

Still “embodiment” can represent something more than the site of the psyche’s “agon” — more than the psyche, for that matter. We must conceive of distributed intelligence, what the American poet Charles Olson called proprioception, the body’s understanding of itself in space. Lyric space, lyric relation. Corporeal knowing. Robert Creeley echoes this idea, repeating famously: “The plan is the body / the plan is the body . . . ” In effect, the difficulties stemming from our physical lives are the incitements of wisdom. We have long understood this notion in the context of aging. Kings Solomon and David are said to have grown virtuous on account of their advanced ages. The French say: “Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse pouvait!” If you’re lucky enough to grow old and infirm you may possess some virtues.\r\n\r\nWhat about the bodies that must struggle daily with the body politic? If Crazy Jane is correct, bodies at all ages know something, something we understand as an admixture of sublimations, faiths, despairs, and determinations. There are secrets to the arts of the body and its accentuations are odd. One thinks of the Tao’s “Ecclesiastes”:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There is a time for being ahead,\r\na time for being behind;\r\na time for being in motion;\r\na time for being at rest;\r\na time for being vigorous;\r\na time for being exhausted;\r\na time for being safe;\r\na time for being in danger.\r\n\r\nThe Master sees things as they are,\r\nwithout trying to control them.\r\nShe lets them go their own way,\r\nand resides at the center of the circle.</blockquote>\r\n— <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, Stephen Mitchell translation\r\n\r\nOne may usefully think of the Master as full embodiment, or in Jungian terms as individuation. What the body “knows” must be seen relative to things as they are and not suborned into easy stories of overcoming — the body knows it is all things at once. That this may be seen as a lyric intelligence is surely sensible. The lyric is fractious, ideogrammatic, uncensored, naive and wise, and it proposes that we carry through our lives as well as we can, that we absorb errors, that certain ideals may be undone, that we may get to knowledge by indirection. Embodiment in literary terms is not far from analytical psychology save for this distinction: writers who sense the body’s ways of knowing are not interested in the closures of self-help narratives. The body’s insights are not a compensation. The body offers steep truths all its own. Different truths, truths of difference.', 'The Lyric Body', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '54-revision-9', '', '', '2010-08-19 19:26:37', '2010-08-20 02:26:37', '', 54, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/54-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Rather than pity himself, Dart hoped to change the lives of millions by hearing the concerns of his fellow disabled humans, politically fighting for equality, and organizing them into a powerful, united group.\r\n\r\nHis accomplishments are too numerous to freshly detail. …but he made history by plotting to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Dart coauthored the 1988 version of the ADA; however, he worried that the bill would encourage segregation rather than inclusion, so at an ADAPT march he publicly likened the disability movement to the civil rights movement of the 60s, declaring, “We are Americans and we will struggle for however long it takes for the same civil rights other Americans have.”  Advocating for the rights of all Americans, Dart greatly admired the 1990 version which he termed the “empowerment version” compared to the 1988 “regulation version.”  It freed very many people, and no one deserved the pen used by President Bush to sign the ADA into law more than the man who received it: Justin Dart.  How many lives he had changed!  The law was signed on July 26, 1990, but Dart’s fight to ensure implementation of the law continued until his death in 2002.  During that time, he traveled to all fifty states more than four times each, defending the rights of people under the law….\r\n\r\nDart lost his life to congestive heart failure on June 21, 2002, but his fight continued.  He even insisted that his funeral be a celebration of the movement and not of him.  He heard the hurtful stories of his people and just look how he changed their future!  Dart gave his people the respect they deserved and tried to ensure their rights by building a unified community and creating national legislation.  Years of hope have been accomplished!  Respect has been established.  You heard the words of Justin Dart.

DJ had been abandoned by his birth father, and neglected and abused by his alcoholic birth mother. He''d been sodomized and further abused in an overcrowded fostercare home where an adolescent boy, also a victim of sexual abuse, had tried to work through his own trauma by violating the then-speechless-thus-perfect-victim, DJ,\r\n\r\nThe story retraces the Savareses'' journey through the twisted legal terrain of fostercare adoption, and into the pioneering territory of full-inclusion for DJ in a public school, in the least-restrictive educational setting, the contested terrain of facilitated communication, and the heartwrenching reunions of DJ and his birth sister — the child who had taken care of her little brother when addiction had rendered their birth mother incapable of mother-work. Through uncompromising love and commitment to DJ and his personhood, the Savareses create a home that is safe enough for DJ to reveal — in his own typed messages — the magnitude of the abuse he''d suffered in fostercare. I did skip ahead to read the last chapter, written by DJ himself, so I know that there is an amazing conclusion, if not a saccharin-laced smiley-faced happy ending.\r\n\r\nWhile there is much to love in this book and this family (pictured here), and much to discuss about it, what appeals so profoundly to me in the story is Savarese''s unwillingness to throw out the baby with the bathwater, whether that baby is his son, a commitment to inclusion and the principle of the least restrictive setting, or the emancipatory possibilities of psychoanalysis — a theory that has a well-deserved bad reputation in the autism world, saddled as it has been with the legacy of mother-blaming encapsulated in Bettelheim''s "refrigerator mother" hypothesis.\r\n\r\nI have been grappling with this very theoretical issue in my own more work, wondering what to do with psychoanalysis, and wondering what atypical language acquistion means for the development of structures like the unconscious and desire.

The book is told memoir-style, telling the story of what it has been like thus far for Savarese and his wife, Emily, an autism inclusion expert, to raise their adopted son, DJ. However, though the main tale is that of life with DJ, Savarese uses this as a platform for the discussion of many larger societal issues that affect us all, whether we know someone with autism or not, (though clearly pretty much anyone reading this blog does.)\r\n\r\nThe first issue, or rather, the first set of issues, he talks about are those of poverty, foster care, and adoption. He discusses in detail his own initial desire to not have children, because doing so would limit his ability to take part in the wider world and would not allow him to devote his time to altruistic causes he believed in. When they first met DJ, he and his wife were devoted to getting DJ and his sister back into their biological mother''s care. Throughout the narration of their prolonged relationship with Rhonda, in which they helped her both financially and in the court system, Savarese also discusses many of the thoughts he had about the cyclic nature of poverty and his desire to see it truly confronted as a societal problem in which everyone needs to take an interest, because it is everyone''s responsibility as a whole. He continued this discussion in his description of the foster care system, in which many of the families providing foster care are poor families doing it for the childcare stipend. He notes that this draws an inadvertent, sometimes antagonistic divide, often along class lines, between prospective adoptive families and foster care families. His stark look at the foster care and state adoption systems reveal a need for change, but also a realistic look at how overtaxed the systems are, being a essentially stopgap measure for addressing much larger societal problems.\r\n\r\nOnce Savarese and his wife succeed in adopting DJ, they are determined to get him into an inclusive educational setting. Up to that point, he had attended a closed center school, in which he had made little progress. Thanks to Emily''s own inclusion expertise and both of the determination of them both to prevail over the school system, they succeeded, and DJ began on the road to literacy and learning. The arguments presented between Emily and the schools, both the center school and the public elementary school, are classic, and powerful, examples of the argument over inclusion.

As it turns out, literacy opens many avenues of communication for DJ, because he says he didn''t learn to decode spoken language until he learned to read. Their efforts towards literacy also led to an inadvertent discovery of facilitated communication (FC), and Savarese spends some time defending the method in its legitimate form, discussing the controversy that surrounded it in the early ''90s, but presenting powerful evidence of research done since then proving its efficacy when used appropriately. He also mentions numerous successful users of FC, who now lead quite rich lives and are able to advocate for themselves. DJ looks well on the way to becoming one of these vocal, or should we say, typing advocates. Indeed, DJ, as well as his parents, have discovered the world of disability/identity politics, and these play a strong role in their story.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the things that makes this book so unique amongst the available books on autism, aside from its focus on adoption, is its exploration of the relationship between trauma and autism. DJ was severely physically and sexually abused by another child in foster care, and it was only after he learned to communicate that he seemed able to assimilate and understand this part of his past. This led to many problems with anxiety, anger, confusion, and separation. Dealing with this through therapy was much more complicated when combined with autism and communicating via FC, and Savarese describes many of the issues they and their therapists faced in dealing with something relatively unknown. Many of the standard therapy techniques became problems in and of themselves, as DJ began to perseverate on his past trauma, rather than moving through the memories to the other side. In addition, the more anxious and upset he became, the more violent and less communicative he would become. The combination of trauma, in this case PTSD, and autism is not a field that has been widely explored, and this book can be considered a call for more attention and research. Savarese points out that the nonverbal in our population are far more likely to suffer abuse, and this problem is probably much more widespread than we would like to think.\r\n\r\nThough Savarese also writes movingly about the meaning of family, particularly in relation to the bond between DJ and his biological sister; dealing with loss in many forms; the relationship between poetry and DJ''s unique perceptions of the world; and numerous other things, I fear that I have run on for too long already, so I''ll simply end here with a recommendation that everyone read this book.

That he was different from other children? No, that was pretty clear. That he has difficulties with speech, and motor planning, and sensory integration, and social situations? No, we got that. That we needed to give him as much therapy as we could reasonably fit into his life--and ours? No, he had a full program of therapies by the time he was two and a half.

That we should just accept all the received wisdom about what a child with autism spectrum disorder can do and will become? That our life as we knew it was over?

I was even more delighted to read his book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em> this past week. Let me say this upfront: it is not a book to pick up lightly. It''s about intense commitment: commitment to a child with autism whose biological parents were unable or unwilling to care for him, who had suffered extreme neglect and abuse, who did not speak, and who, with the aid of his adoptive parents'' incredible love and persistence and ingenuity and patience, learns to communicate independently, reflect on his past, participate and excel in school and give us a glimpse--more than a glimpse--into what autism feels like from the inside.\r\n\r\nHeroic? Heartwarming? A triumph of the human spirit? I would say yes, actually, but that''s not at all what Savarese is after. Like any thoughtful memoirist, he resists the narcissism inherent in the form, and it gnaws at him throughout the book. He doesn''t want to be praised or idealized. He''s not looking for the easy out. He insists meticulously on detailing his own doubts, faults, frailties through the process of bonding with, adopting and raising his son DJ. He doesn''t shy from political, cultural, psychological, even literary analysis of autism and disability. He wants us to see it all: the anguish, the confusion, the joys, the mistakes, the odd trajectories of progress and regression.\r\n\r\nMost stunning about this book is that, through the process of facilitated communication (in which he types his thoughts with some slight physical assistance from his parents), DJ becomes able to express himself and thus tell his own story. Savarese includes many of DJ''s thoughts, poems and school assignments throughout the book, up to and including the final chapter, which is DJ''s work entirely (I did find myself wishing that his wife had had a chapter too). I won''t go into the whole facilitated communication debate here (Savarese covers that in great detail), but I was touched to hear this lovely boy''s voice as he wrestled with the circumstances of his life and of his own identity, finally coming to a kind of peace.

Again, and not wishing to give away too much, let me simply quote one of DJ’s own poems which appears near the end of the book.  It is as fine a definition of poetry and the life of the mind as I have ever seen:\n\n<blockquote>HOW BRAVE?\nHe was so brave that free people\nSaluted him every time he passed by.\nSo brave, if you didn''t really know him\nYou''d think he was a god.\nSo brave, the tests he took couldn''t\nScare him.\nAnd so brave, all the dreadful creatures\nDied.\nThat''s brave!</blockquote>', 'Planet of the Blind', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '181-revision', '', '', '2010-08-23 11:00:29', '2010-08-23 18:00:29', '', 181, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/181-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa, writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.\r\n\r\nEmily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.\r\n\r\nAs the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:\r\n\r\n“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”\r\n\r\nIt pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:\r\n\r\n“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,\r\n\r\n“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”\r\n\r\nAs DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”\r\n\r\nThere may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,\r\n\r\n‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”\r\n\r\nRalph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.\r\n\r\n“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”\r\n\r\nIn Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.\r\n\r\nFor all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:\r\n\r\n“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations. This is, however, a story about what life is all about: trial, error, perseverance, and faith in people. Faith in love.

I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the street.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations. He is sensitive to how others speak to his son and how they generalize about his disability.\r\n\r\nSon DJ, 15, would be coming home shortly from his second day of the new school year. He has autism.\r\n\r\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the professionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and puzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and unpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began talking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h3>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h3>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children were taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on the failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe autism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and years of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to converse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own cranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t want to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few will do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the developmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and compulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away. After several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the hospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy. At the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h3>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h3>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa- Henderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now teaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the diagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also remains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s communication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing. I asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a straight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There are frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe insecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at odds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which talks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had become stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic expressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with her.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be reasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for reasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople. com.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown, squealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been working on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his place in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged him to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York literary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with autism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting hopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the anxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up better boy''s resentment.

I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the\nstreet.\n\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations.

He has autism.\n\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\n\nThe story was far from Disney.\n\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\n\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the\nprofessionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\n\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\n\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\n\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\n\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\n\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and\npuzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and\nunpredictable meltdowns.\n\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself.

It was a reasonable question in this age of narrow self-concern — far more reasonable, or at least more reasonably put, than many of the other questions we fielded.\r\n\r\nFor example, "Why don''t you have your own children?" a wealthy relative inquired, as if natural family-making were a kind of gated community it was best never to abandon. "You two have such good genes," she added. "Why waste them?"\r\n\r\nA colleague at work confronted me in the mailroom with this memorable gem: "Have you tried in-vitro?" She feared that we hadn''t availed ourselves of the many wondrous technologies that rescue infertile couples. "Wouldn''t that be better than adopting a child with a disability?" she asked, drawing out the word "disability." "God knows what that kid''s parents were doing when they conceived him."\r\n\r\n"We''re not infertile," I barked. "We have a relationship with the boy."\r\n\r\nMy wife, an autism expert, had offered his mother services, but as the woman found it increasingly difficult to care for her son and then dropped out of the picture altogether, we''d started spending time with him. His first communicative act with language, at age 3 — the sign for "more" — we''d taught him while tickling his belly.\r\n\r\nHe later made that sign in the emergency room of a hospital where he was brought after being beaten in foster care. Upon seeing us — we''d been called in to try to calm him — he stopped in his tracks, paused (as if to allow some associative chain to complete itself) and demanded obsessively to be tickled. I remember searching on his chest for unbruised patches among the purple, blue and black. He was that frantic in his quest for the familiar and, dare I say, for love.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I can''t believe how callous people were; the strange anxiety that adopting a child with a disability provoked. And the anxiety just kept coming. "Healthy white infants must be tough to get," a neighbor commented. No paragons of racial sensitivity, we were nevertheless appalled by the idea that we''d do anything to avoid adopting, say, a black child or a Latino one.\r\n\r\nAs offensive was the assumption that we must be devout Christians: hyperbolic, designated do-gooders with a joint eye firmly on some final prize. "God''s reserving a special place for you," we heard on more than one occasion, as if our son deserved pity and we were allowed neither our flaws nor a different understanding of social commitment. The journalist Adam Pertman, in his otherwise excellent book, "Adoption Nation," reproduces this logic exactly when he speaks of "children so challenging that only the most saintly among us would think [my italics] of tackling their behavioral and physical problems."\r\n\r\nDespite the stigma attached to "special-needs children," people do adopt these kids. And yet, many more Americans spend gobs of money on fertility treatments or travel to foreign countries to find their perfect little bundles. I''m haunted by something my son wrote after we taught him how to read and type on a computer: "I want you to be proud of me. I dream of that because in foster care I had no one." How many kids lie in bed at night and think something similar?\r\n\r\nThe physical and behavioral problems have been significant, at times even crushing. The last eight years have been devoted almost exclusively to my son''s welfare: literacy training, occupational therapy, relationship building, counseling for post-traumatic stress — the list goes on and on. But what strides he has made.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was still in diapers and said to be retarded when he came to live with us is now a straight-A student at our local middle school. He''s literally rewriting the common scripts of autism and "attachment disorder" (the broad diagnosis for the problems of abandoned and traumatized kids). These are hopeless scripts, unforgiving scripts in which the child can''t give back.\r\n\r\nMy son does, and others can as well. Recently, in response to my hip replacement, he typed on his computer, "I''m nervous because Dad has not brought me braces [his word for crutches]." I was just home from the hospital — wobbly, a bit depressed, in pain. To my question, "Why do you need crutches?" he responded endearingly, "You know how I like to be just like you."

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\r\n\r\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\r\n\r\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\r\n\r\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\r\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\r\n\r\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently. Since the eighteenth century, the criteria for human species membership have been determined in great part by mental capacity and especially linguistic capability. Whether those in whom linguistic capability is compromised will be accorded a full set of human rights surfaces as the foremost question whenever non-verbal cognitive impairment comes under scrutiny. Indirectly addressing the issue is Gayatri Spivak''s 1988 essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in which she investigates whether the historically marginalized, colonized people truly are empowered to speak. For Spivak, the subaltern must be able to voice challenges to mistaken assumptions. Especially in the last thirty years, people with physical disabilities at least have spoken up for themselves through disability autobiography. G. Thomas Couser describes this genre as "an anti-colonial phenomenon, a form of autoethnography, as Mary Louise Pratt has defined it: ''instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in way that engage with [read: contest] the colonizer''s own terms.''" If people with physical disabilities can represent themselves and ''talk back'' to the hegemonic ablist culture through autobiography, how is a non-verbal person with a mental disability to do the same? In the grown-up-driven genre of the parental memoir, the adult speaks for the child. Consequently, with regard to these memoirs, a central concern for a reader coming from a disability rights perspective will be the degree of contact afforded between reader and child by the mediating parent-author.\r\n\r\nSavarese follows Oe''s lead by opening a space for DJ to present himself to the reader: the young man contributes the sixteenth and final chapter entitled "It''s My Story!" The memoir''s first fifteen chapters really serve as prologue, explaining how DJ''s chapter came to be written. It is from this section in fact that the title Reasonable People derives; DJ writes, "I''m reasonable. Polite people make me feel comfortable. Which by the way isn''t very often. Reasonable people promote very very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me." Of the way he should be treated, he states, "People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind." Of the self-esteem beginning to shape up within him, he proclaims that "Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, kind, mighty, very smart self." In another passage he associates himself with the civil rights movement, and in another he contests the culturally fabricated assumptions of the neurotypical majority about people like him. At one point he even ''talks back'' to his former teachers in Florida, criticizing them sharply with regard to the education he received: "[Y]ears of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start could have begun sooner."\r\n\r\nWhat G. Thomas Couser observes of such texts as the 1994 <em>Count Us In:Growing Up with Down Syndrome</em> by Jason Kingsley and Mitchell Levitz could be extended to DJ''s chapter: "the very existence of first-person narratives makes its own point: that people with condition ''X'' are capable of self-representation. The autobiographical act models the agency and self-determination that the disability rights movement has fought for." Like Spivak''s subaltern, the purportedly nonverbal person with an intellectual disability not only can but will speak. In at least four ways this book makes a significant contribution to the national conversation on autism and to Disability Studies. First, "It''s My Story!" can be excerpted and read as a freestanding essay, perhaps in some future anthology of writing by people with learning disabilities.

It may be appropriate high school reading as well. Second, the book in its entirety can educate parents, teachers, and psychologists, encouraging them to experiment with Emily and Ralph''s techniques that worked so well with DJ. Third, it will reawaken interest in FC, by means of which DJ has been empowered to contest his supposedly ''non-verbal'' status.

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\n\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\n\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\n\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\nprogress.\n\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\n\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\n\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\n\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently.

My mantra—"she’s easy to love, but hard to raise"—is inadequate in describing either the intense love and joy or the chaos and exhaustion she’s brought to my life.\r\n\r\n<em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em>, by Ralph James Savarese (Other Press; $25.95), states—clearly, concisely, and with passion—why some people adopt. Why some people adopt kids with special needs. Why we adopted Natalie. It’s a powerful, complex book about "what hope and commitment can accomplish."\r\n\r\nSavarese, a professor at Grinnell College, and his wife, an expert on autism and inclusion, adopted their son, DJ, from the U.S. foster system when he was six. DJ has autism. He doesn’t speak, and he experienced severe trauma before joining his family. Woven into the story of their adoption journey, the challenges and triumphs they’ve shared along the way, are Savarese’s treatises on the politics of differing abilities, foster care and adoption, and the meaning of family.\r\n\r\nIt’s an intellectually (morally, ideologically) challenging read. But to say it’s "worth the challenge" would imply that I had to slog through it. That’s not true—I could hardly put it down. DJ, who now practices "facilitated communication," using a computer, wrote the final chapter himself. "I resent these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone," he writes. It isn’t easy reading, DJ. It’s life-changing reading.\r\n\r\nI e-mailed Savarese, hoping for a quote I could include in my review. Reading it gave me shivers. It will tell you, more clearly than I ever could, why you should read the book.\r\n\r\nIn the author’s words:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I hate the fetish of blood relations. Not only does it make adopted children and families feel like second-class citizens, but it perniciously tells us that our ethical obligations extend no further than our natural (as opposed to artificial) ties. So screw the homeless man on the street or the poor family on the other side of town. So long as I''m good to my mother, well, then, I''m a good person. Baloney! We need to open our eyes to the predicaments of those less fortunate; we need to look beyond the walls of the gated community that is often the blood family. More creative family making might actually help us to realize the sentimental trope of the “human family.”\r\n\r\nFor my wife and me, adoption was a FIRST-resort adventure in responding to the desperate plight of a badly abused, wordless little boy. This boy has given us MORE than we have given him. Has it been exhausting? You bet; the most exhausting and challenging and anxiety-producing thing I have ever done. Ever. But also the most rewarding.\r\n\r\nWhy are we on this planet? I believe to grow in our capacity to care and attend to human suffering. By stretching ourselves, sometimes beyond measure, we find a joy that approximates wisdom. My wife and I are NOT saints and don''t appreciate being compared to such beings. Our relationship has suffered. We don''t have time for the many things we used to do. But whose relationship hasn''t suffered with the arrival of kids, whether adopted or not? Looking back on the last 10 years, we marvel at what hope and commitment can accomplish.</blockquote>', 'Adoptive Families', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'adoptive-families', '', '', '2010-09-20 12:55:41', '2010-09-20 19:55:41', '', 0, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/?p=192', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Their road together continues to be rough, but today the preteen boy attends mainstream classes and, as the final, in-his-own-words chapter confirms, possesses marvelous perceptive and communicative skills.

I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations. He is sensitive to how others speak to his son and how they generalize about his disability.\r\n\r\nSon DJ, 15, would be coming home shortly from his second day of the new school year. He has autism.\r\n\r\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the\r\nprofessionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and\r\npuzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and\r\nunpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began\r\ntalking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h4>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h4>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children\r\nwere taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on\r\nthe failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe\r\nautism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and\r\nyears of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to\r\nconverse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own\r\ncranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t\r\nwant to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few\r\nwill do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the\r\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and\r\ncompulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away.\r\nAfter several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the\r\nhospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy.\r\nAt the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h4>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa-\r\nHenderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now\r\nteaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the\r\ndiagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also\r\nremains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing.\r\nI asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a\r\nstraight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There\r\nare frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe\r\ninsecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at\r\nodds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which\r\ntalks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had\r\nbecome stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be\r\nreasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for\r\nreasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople.\r\ncom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown,\r\nsquealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been\r\nworking on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these\r\nvery hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his\r\nplace in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged\r\nhim to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York\r\nliterary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with\r\nautism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting\r\nhopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the\r\nanxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up\r\nbetter boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will\r\nhave to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get\r\nmad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re\r\nsmart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\r\ncan understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future.

There is lots of evidence on both sides of the debate.  What I’d ask of skeptics is to keep an open mind while investigating the phenomenon.  Most people do not realize that there are now studies that confirm, or partially confirm, the technique’s efficacy with at least some non-speaking people with autism.  Nor do they realize that a growing number of users have weaned themselves from their facilitators’ support and are now typing independently.  Some who still require support have successfully passed message-passing protocols.  Some have even learned to speak through typing!

Let’s have a full and honest discussion.  As part of that discussion, let’s consider new research from Morton Gernsbacher and Laurent Mottron that suggests we have been using the wrong tests to measure intelligence and “theory of mind” in people with autism.  By changing the testing vehicles, research subjects were able to score much higher than before, rendering the claim of mental retardation and lack of social awareness in a vast majority of people with autism quite dubious.  If scientists have fundamentally misunderstood autism, then it is not so unreasonable to imagine that FC might work—at least for some.    \r\n\r\nReaders of my book will see that Emily and I spent years teaching DJ how to be literate.  Only when he “proved” his competence by pointing independently at answers on a page or blackboard did everyone—parents, teachers, aides—feel comfortable with the notion of facilitated communication.  (If a person is not literate, FC can’t possibly work.)  Some critics have suggested that we should have waited to publish this story after DJ had achieved independence. I would respond that independent typing can take years to accomplish and, moreover, that some might never be able to accomplish it for reasons that are still unclear.  The idea of waiting for total independence at the keyboard before one accepts the communication of people with classical autism is both cruel and unfair.  At the same time, one has to be very careful about facilitator influence. \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a project that looks at DJ’s and others’ communication in a manner akin to how literary scholars determine whether a newly discovered poem might be that of a particular author—by doing statistical analyses of diction, syntax, figures of speech, etc.  DJ has multiple facilitators (some fifteen) and his very idiosyncratic style remains the same across this group.  So, in addition to naïve facilitators producing information that they could not have known, they produce it in a style that is consistent, though the facilitators themselves could not be more different with regard to age, gender, income level, educational background, and political convictions.  Along with message-passing tests, this sort of corroboration should lend more credence to FC.  If scholars in the contentious field of literary studies can come to a consensus about a new Shakespeare poem, perhaps psychologists, neurologists, special-ed teachers and the like can come to a consensus about the efficacy of facilitated communication with some non-speaking people with autism.  I should say that I am also commencing a study of this idiosyncratic style itself—what I call the “neuro-poetics of autistic discourse.”  A version of it shows up in many non-speaking people with autism.  By emphasizing the beauty of such communication, we can all push back against the tendency to pathologize difference.\r\n\r\nWith respect to DJ’s writings on this web site and in the book, I would underscore DJ’s capacity, when pushed, to mimic neuro-typical discourse, though not completely.  In his Justin Dart term paper, for instance, you can still see traces of his idiosyncratic diction: “Dart’s accomplishments are too numerous to freshly detail.”  “Fresh” is one of DJ’s favorite words, and it shows up in all sorts of places and in all sorts of unexpected ways. “Dad has written a book about my fresh start,” he writes in a letter to the teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him.  When left to his own devices—that is, when simply conversing—he produces a version of DJ speak, as in his “Note to Dad”: “Yes.dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me.  yes.  yes.  yes.  yes.”  As with any neuro-typical child who is simply conversing, we don’t pressure DJ to produce perfect English when he is typing.  With his school assignments, however, we encourage him to conform to the conventions of standard English.  We have marveled at his capacity to do this—he is a straight “A” language arts students—while preserving some aspects of his style.  He has an uncanny ability to organize his thoughts; he understands how an argument works, and these skills only continue to improve.  But there is still something there that is distinctly atypical about his communication, something irreducibly him.  So, on the web site and in the book you will see a range of writings, produced at different ages and with different objectives in mind.  Some things—whether poems or school assignments—have been extensively revised (by him); others have not.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to address the critics who, without having read the book (they acknowledge as much), have said some particular noxious things about DJ’s experience of sexual abuse.  There is no doubt that facilitated communication became enmeshed in the recovered memory controversy of the early-to-mid-1990s when claims of sexual abuse ran wild.  There were FC users who typed allegations of sexual abuse that were clearly untrue, but there were also some users who typed legitimate allegations.  Some of these allegations have even stood up in court.  Here’s what we know about DJ: he was viciously attacked in foster care at the age of three by a much older boy whose father had sexually abused him.  The authorities worried enough about sexual abuse in DJ’s attack that they specifically asked the doctor who was attending to his physical injuries to look for signs of sexual violation.  Though the doctor found none, she admitted that she wasn’t at all familiar with male rape.  Emily and I never once mentioned this possibility precisely because we feared planting the idea in his head.  Years later, after DJ was literate and began working through his past, he reported to multiple naïve facilitators that he had been raped.  If critics of FC want to imagine that Emily and I have “dirty minds,” they should talk to the psychiatrist and psychologists who treated DJ and were absolutely convinced that he had been sexual traumatized.

There is lots of evidence on both sides of the debate.  What I’d ask of skeptics is to keep an open mind while investigating the phenomenon.  Most people do not realize that there are now studies that confirm, or partially confirm, the technique’s efficacy with at least some non-speaking people with autism.  Nor do they realize that a growing number of users have weaned themselves from their facilitators’ support and are now typing independently.  Some who still require support have successfully passed message-passing protocols.  Some have even learned to speak through typing!  If Doug Biklen, Director of the Facilitated Communication Institute and Dean of Syracuse University’s School of Education, can post on the Institute’s web site studies that have both proven and disproven FC, then the technique’s critics ought to be able to confront the new developments I mention above.  Let’s have a full and honest discussion.  As part of that discussion, let’s consider new research from Morton Gernsbacher and Laurent Mottron that suggests we have been using the wrong tests to measure intelligence and “theory of mind” in people with autism.  By changing the testing vehicles, research subjects were able to score much higher than before, rendering the claim of mental retardation and lack of social awareness in a vast majority of people with autism quite dubious.  If scientists have fundamentally misunderstood autism, then it is not so unreasonable to imagine that FC might work—at least for some.    \r\n\r\nReaders of my book will see that Emily and I spent years teaching DJ how to be literate.  Only when he “proved” his competence by pointing independently at answers on a page or blackboard did everyone—parents, teachers, aides—feel comfortable with the notion of facilitated communication.  (If a person is not literate, FC can’t possibly work.)  Some critics have suggested that we should have waited to publish this story after DJ had achieved independence. I would respond that independent typing can take years to accomplish and, moreover, that some might never be able to accomplish it for reasons that are still unclear.  The idea of waiting for total independence at the keyboard before one accepts the communication of people with classical autism is both cruel and unfair.  At the same time, one has to be very careful about facilitator influence. \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a project that looks at DJ’s and others’ communication in a manner akin to how literary scholars determine whether a newly discovered poem might be that of a particular author—by doing statistical analyses of diction, syntax, figures of speech, etc.  DJ has multiple facilitators (some fifteen) and his very idiosyncratic style remains the same across this group.  So, in addition to naïve facilitators producing information that they could not have known, they produce it in a style that is consistent, though the facilitators themselves could not be more different with regard to age, gender, income level, educational background, and political convictions.  Along with message-passing tests, this sort of corroboration should lend more credence to FC.  If scholars in the contentious field of literary studies can come to a consensus about a new Shakespeare poem, perhaps psychologists, neurologists, special-ed teachers and the like can come to a consensus about the efficacy of facilitated communication with some non-speaking people with autism.  I should say that I am also commencing a study of this idiosyncratic style itself—what I call the “neuro-poetics of autistic discourse.”  A version of it shows up in many non-speaking people with autism.  By emphasizing the beauty of such communication, we can all push back against the tendency to pathologize difference.\r\n\r\nWith respect to DJ’s writings on this web site and in the book, I would underscore DJ’s capacity, when pushed, to mimic neuro-typical discourse, though not completely.  In his Justin Dart term paper, for instance, you can still see traces of his idiosyncratic diction: “Dart’s accomplishments are too numerous to freshly detail.”  “Fresh” is one of DJ’s favorite words, and it shows up in all sorts of places and in all sorts of unexpected ways. “Dad has written a book about my fresh start,” he writes in a letter to the teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him.  When left to his own devices—that is, when simply conversing—he produces a version of DJ speak, as in his “Note to Dad”: “Yes.dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me.  yes.  yes.  yes.  yes.”  As with any neuro-typical child who is simply conversing, we don’t pressure DJ to produce perfect English when he is typing.  With his school assignments, however, we encourage him to conform to the conventions of standard English.  We have marveled at his capacity to do this—he is a straight “A” language arts students—while preserving some aspects of his style.  He has an uncanny ability to organize his thoughts; he understands how an argument works, and these skills only continue to improve.  But there is still something there that is distinctly atypical about his communication, something irreducibly him.  So, on the web site and in the book you will see a range of writings, produced at different ages and with different objectives in mind.  Some things—whether poems or school assignments—have been extensively revised (by him); others have not.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to address the critics who, without having read the book (they acknowledge as much), have said some particular noxious things about DJ’s experience of sexual abuse.  There is no doubt that facilitated communication became enmeshed in the recovered memory controversy of the early-to-mid-1990s when claims of sexual abuse ran wild.  There were FC users who typed allegations of sexual abuse that were clearly untrue, but there were also some users who typed legitimate allegations.  Some of these allegations have even stood up in court.  Here’s what we know about DJ: he was viciously attacked in foster care at the age of three by a much older boy whose father had sexually abused him.  The authorities worried enough about sexual abuse in DJ’s attack that they specifically asked the doctor who was attending to his physical injuries to look for signs of sexual violation.  Though the doctor found none, she admitted that she wasn’t at all familiar with male rape.  Emily and I never once mentioned this possibility precisely because we feared planting the idea in his head.  Years later, after DJ was literate and began working through his past, he reported to multiple naïve facilitators that he had been raped.  If critics of FC want to imagine that Emily and I have “dirty minds,” they should talk to the psychiatrist and psychologists who treated DJ and were absolutely convinced that he had been sexual traumatized.

Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the professionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and puzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and unpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began talking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h3>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h3>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children were taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on the failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe autism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and years of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to converse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own cranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t want to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few will do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the developmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and compulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away. After several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the hospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy. At the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h3>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h3>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa- Henderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now teaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the diagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also remains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s communication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing. I asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a straight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There are frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe insecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at odds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which talks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had become stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic expressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with her.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be reasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for reasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople. com.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown, squealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been working on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his place in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged him to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York literary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with autism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting hopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the anxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up better boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get mad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re smart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really can understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future. Years of fresh start have begun!\r\n\r\nYour respectful student,\r\nDJ Savarese"', 'Des Moines Register', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '187-revision-8', '', '', '2010-09-20 21:14:54', '2010-09-21 04:14:54', '', 187, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/187-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\r\n\r\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\r\n\r\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\r\n\r\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\r\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\r\n\r\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently. Since the eighteenth century, the criteria for human species membership have been determined in great part by mental capacity and especially linguistic capability. Whether those in whom linguistic capability is compromised will be accorded a full set of human rights surfaces as the foremost question whenever non-verbal cognitive impairment comes under scrutiny. Indirectly addressing the issue is Gayatri Spivak''s 1988 essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in which she investigates whether the historically marginalized, colonized people truly are empowered to speak. For Spivak, the subaltern must be able to voice challenges to mistaken assumptions. Especially in the last thirty years, people with physical disabilities at least have spoken up for themselves through disability autobiography. G. Thomas Couser describes this genre as "an anti-colonial phenomenon, a form of autoethnography, as Mary Louise Pratt has defined it: ''instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in way that engage with [read: contest] the colonizer''s own terms.''" If people with physical disabilities can represent themselves and ''talk back'' to the hegemonic ablist culture through autobiography, how is a non-verbal person with a mental disability to do the same? In the grown-up-driven genre of the parental memoir, the adult speaks for the child. Consequently, with regard to these memoirs, a central concern for a reader coming from a disability rights perspective will be the degree of contact afforded between reader and child by the mediating parent-author.\r\n\r\nSavarese follows Oe''s lead by opening a space for DJ to present himself to the reader: the young man contributes the sixteenth and final chapter entitled "It''s My Story!" The memoir''s first fifteen chapters really serve as prologue, explaining how DJ''s chapter came to be written. It is from this section in fact that the title Reasonable People derives; DJ writes, "I''m reasonable. Polite people make me feel comfortable. Which by the way isn''t very often. Reasonable people promote very very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me." Of the way he should be treated, he states, "People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind." Of the self-esteem beginning to shape up within him, he proclaims that "Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, kind, mighty, very smart self." In another passage he associates himself with the civil rights movement, and in another he contests the culturally fabricated assumptions of the neurotypical majority about people like him. At one point he even ''talks back'' to his former teachers in Florida, criticizing them sharply with regard to the education he received: "[Y]ears of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start could have begun sooner."\r\n\r\nWhat G. Thomas Couser observes of such texts as the 1994 <em>Count Us In:Growing Up with Down Syndrome</em> by Jason Kingsley and Mitchell Levitz could be extended to DJ''s chapter: "the very existence of first-person narratives makes its own point: that people with condition ''X'' are capable of self-representation. The autobiographical act models the agency and self-determination that the disability rights movement has fought for." Like Spivak''s subaltern, the purportedly nonverbal person with an intellectual disability not only can but will speak. In at least four ways this book makes a significant contribution to the national conversation on autism and to Disability Studies. First, "It''s My Story!" can be excerpted and read as a freestanding essay, perhaps in some future anthology of writing by people with learning disabilities. But even if such an anthology never materializes, this powerful piece of first-person exposition should find its way onto the reading lists of university-level Education and Cultural Disability Studies courses. It may be appropriate high school reading as well. Second, the book in its entirety can educate parents, teachers, and psychologists, encouraging them to experiment with Emily and Ralph''s techniques that worked so well with DJ. Third, it will reawaken interest in FC, by means of which DJ has been empowered to contest his supposedly ''non-verbal'' status. And fourth, those who read it will be forced to think twice about the various conventional wisdoms associated with autism, to expand their thinking, and in the end, hopefully, to reconsider "what is possible."', 'Disability Studies Quarterly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '189-revision-6', '', '', '2010-09-20 13:46:38', '2010-09-20 20:46:38', '', 189, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/189-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Activist and writer Ralph James Savarese thought he and his wife, Emily, had done just that. For her it meant working with a Florida center for disabled and autistic children. For him it meant writing and teaching college students about responsibility and social obligation. But in the late ''90s they found themselves forgoing these larger causes for the smaller one staring them right in the face: an abused, autistic toddler named DJ.\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association describes autism as a disorder of impaired communication and social skills (including the delay or total lack of spoken language) and restricted or repetitive behavior such as flapping of the hands. But that view, argues Savarese in “Reasonable People: a Memoir of Autism and Adoption,” robs people with autism of their humanity and in return offers little hope. “To many experts, the non-speaking autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.” Are we giving up too early on those with classic autism, he asks? Or could it be that an autist’s inner world, dynamic and profoundly human, can be made accessible if society is willing to make a reasonable effort to help it bloom?\r\n\r\nThe couple is first acquainted with the blond, curly-haired DJ when he is 3 years old and foundering in foster care. Emily works with DJ, whom she meets at her center, even though he’s been written off as profoundly retarded. She also tries, and fails, to get DJ’s alcoholic mother back on her feet. When DJ is severely beaten at his foster home, a caseworker begs the Savareses to provide emergency shelter. What follows is both a real-life love story and an urgent manifesto for the rights of people with neurological differences. Savarese is honest about both his own fears and how DJ is capable of plunging even the most dedicated and high-minded adult into despair. But three years and countless bureaucratic hurdles later, the Savarese family finally extracts DJ from foster care and formally adopts him.\r\n\r\nTheir aims are lofty. First, DJ’s is an “open adoption,” meaning that visits from his older sister or other family members are encouraged. Second, Savarese and his wife are proponents of a controversial educational method called “inclusion.” With the help of on-site personal aides, they manage to include DJ in regular classrooms in Florida and then Iowa. They tirelessly urge others to open their hearts and minds to the “creative potential” of DJ’s disease, even though he might flap his arms, use his head as a battering ram and scream uncontrollably. Through the much-maligned keyboard technique of “facilitated communication,” they help DJ make his first forays into language. At first the parents do much of the typing themselves; within a few years they are offering DJ only minimal support at the wrist. He has much to share, including a heartbreaking, garbled tale of abandonment and sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a thorough chronicler of both DJ’s progress and the current thinking on autism. At times his writing can be overly academic, but not when it comes to detailing DJ’s life and the ease with which disabled children are often written off. In foster care DJ was denied glasses--the doctor thought he was too severely disabled for improved vision to make a difference. So he has difficulty with tasks requiring hand-eye coordination--he does puzzles entirely by touch--until his adoptive parents figured out the problem. At first the simplest word in sign language took months to perfect. Yet by the end of Savarese’s moving memoir, DJ is in sixth grade and getting all “A’s” at a regular school. “DJ’s autism remains--in all of its sometimes marvelous, sometimes aggravating, splendor,” writes Savarese. “He hasn’t been cured.”  Nor has he conquered many troubling habits, such as poking people in the eyes. But the sixth-grader writes the memoir’s last chapter himself, with only minimal assistance. There are typos and DJ’s language is often inscrutable. But his words are evidence of qualities once thought impossible for the boy: a sense of self and a concern for others. “They think well-respected, tested-as-normal kids are the OK-to-teach ones,” writes DJ. “They forget these lost kids. ”  Perhaps this book will help others remember they are more than worth the effort.', 'Newsweek', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-revision-4', '', '', '2010-09-20 12:57:27', '2010-09-20 19:57:27', '', 185, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/185-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

This applies as much to DJ, whom Emily met while she was assistant director of a center for autism and related disabilities, as it does to the Savareses.

Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="http://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savarese--Nervous-Wrecks-and-Ginger-nuts.pdf">"Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts" (PDF)</a>', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts: Bartleby at a Standstill', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '609-revision-8', '', '', '2010-10-10 19:40:43', '2010-10-11 02:40:43', '', 609, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/609-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I had read his first book of poems, <em>Only Bread, Only Light</em>, and his two memoirs, the hugely popular <em>Planet of the Blind</em> and the recently released <em>Eavesdropping: A Memoir of Blindness and Listening</em>. I had also read his completed new manuscript of poems, <em>Mornings with Borges</em>, forthcoming from Copper Canyon Press in 2010. Having already met Steve when I invited him to give a reading and workshop at Grinnell College, I was familiar with his old guide dog, Vidal, who had just retired, but not his new dog, Nira, who seemed a paragon of affectionate placidity and navagational competence. Over several cups of coffee, we spoke about a great many things but kept circling back to questions of the lyric mode and its usefulness to the project of disability studies. Steve is a wildly energetic man, learned, unbelievably funny—a kind of walking surrealist. Think Johnny Carson meets André Breton meets the entire library at the University of Iowa, where he teaches in the graduate nonfiction program and the eye clinic at the medical college. He is also a passionate activist working on behalf of those with disabilities. A truly public intellectual, he has appeared on countless national and regional TV and radio programs, including <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, <em>Dateline NBC</em>, and NPR’s <em>Talk of the Nation</em>.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="http://www.ralphsavarese.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/KuusistoInterview.pdf">Lyric Anger and the Victrola in the Attic: An Interview with Stephen Kuusisto</a>.', 'Lyric Anger and the Victrola in the Attic: An Interview with Stephen Kuusisto', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'lyric-anger-and-the-victrola-in-the-attic-an-interview-with-stephen-kuusisto', '', '', '2011-08-07 16:29:39', '2011-08-07 23:29:39', '', 0, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/?p=847', 0, 'post', '', 0);

"Sad Dear Saved Me"</h3>\r\n\r\n"Hours of light like heat hibernate/great icebergs hear the cries of hurt." So, my son, adopted at the age of six from foster care, began a poem entitled, "Alaska." Written on a communcation device in the fifth grade, it establishes a number of exquisite analogies--between light and bears and calving icebergs and "hurt" people. By "hurt" people he means kids such as himself who were abandoned by their parents, kids with disabilities forced to survive in a land of unremitting darkness.\r\n\r\nThat darkness included the worst sort of physical and sexual abuse and you can see him find in the natural setting of Alaska the unlit bedroom in which the abuse took place.  Indeed, you can see him find the saga of his entire early life: separation from his parents and sister, then frigid loneliness and injury--the two compressed into an image that does not behave, as my sentence just did, chronologically.  The awful calving refers <em>both</em> to the loss of family and to the physical experience of rape, of being split open, as my son explained almost too matter-of-factly.  At once inarticulate and faintly human, the sound of that calving seems an apt correlative for the cry of childhood trauma--especially apt in the case of a boy who literally cannot speak and who, back then, had no way of communicating what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nAs Alaska waits in winter for warmth it can barely imagine coming, so my son waited for relief from his attacker and, even less probably, for parents who might love him. "Yes. dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes.," he typed recently on his talking computer.  We had been conversing about the past--in particular, my decision not to have kids and my own experience of depression.  And there he was the voice of triumphant spring, in all of its freshness, reminding me to be hopeful. Remind me in that language, that poetry, I have come to think of as "Autie-type."\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="http://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savares--The-Lobes-of-Autobiography.pdf">"The Lobes of Autobiography: Poetry and Autism" (PDF)</a>\r\n', 'The Lobes of Autobiography: Poetry and Autism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '595-revision-8', '', '', '2010-09-27 19:47:45', '2010-09-28 02:47:45', '', 595, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/595-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Adapting George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s notion of “philosophy in the flesh”—the fact that cognition is embodied, which is to say radically conditioned by physiological systems—it analyzes the nonfiction work of\r\nTito Mukhopadhyay, an Indian writer in America whom the medical community would describe as “severely” autistic. The article contends that Mukhopadhyay’s alternative embodiment gives rise to both a different sense of relation and a different way with words, each in some respects preferable to the neurotypical standard. Paying attention to Mukhopadhyay’s body challenges— with proprioception, sensory processing, over- and under-inclusion of details in his apprehension of the environment, word finding, a drive to associate, a persistent animism, and synesthesia—\r\nit suggests that he is a cross-cultural, cross-sensorial migrant: a neuro-cosmopolitan armed with metaphor in a world that is often quite hostile to the neurological other. Finally, it situates Mukhopadhyay’s writing squarely in the burgeoning neurodiversity movement, which, though recognizing the difficulties that autism often presents, nonetheless asks that it be treated and accommodated as difference.\r\n\r\nRead <a href="http://www.ralphsavarese.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PostColonialNeurologyPDFsavarese.pdf">Toward a Postcolonial Neurology (PDF)</a>.', 'Toward a Postcolonial Neurology: Autism, Tito Mukhopadhyay, and a New Geo-poetics of the Body', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '854-revision-2', '', '', '2011-08-07 17:43:00', '2011-08-08 00:43:00', '', 854, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/854-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

If facilitated communication is a practice meant to enable those who might otherwise go unheard to communicate with the assistance or support of others, then certainly we are all practitioners. As the various poetic invocations of the memoir demonstrate, your own voice is indelibly tied to the devices and inventive potentials of literature and poetry. In that spirit, I would like to conjure a philosophical voice which has augmented my own communication and summarizes my reactions to Reasonable People. This is a statement on pragmatist ethics which I admire for its particular willingness to substitute social and emotional relevancy for technical sophistication. “Moral development in the individual, and moral progress in the human species as a whole, is a matter of re-marking human selves so as to enlarge the variety of relationships which constitute those selves. […] Pragmatists think of moral progress as more like sewing together a very large, elaborate, polychrome quilt, than like getting a clearer vision of something true and deep. […]So it is best to think of moral progress as a matter of increasing sensitivity, increasing responsiveness to the needs of a larger and larger variety of people and things” (R. Rorty, Ethics without Principles, 1994).\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of Reasonable People is to confront social injustice through the life and actions of one family, without becoming politically sterile. The memoir inspires moral indignation and reasonable political expectations that we can all contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian society with efforts that are neither heroic nor unreasonable, but simply sensible individuals encouraged by compassion and interested in building a more creative and diverse social landscape which enriches our own lives. Americans are often ready to make ‘easy reading’ of memoirs such as Reasonable People, but the unique virtue of this work is that it denies its readers a packaged tale of triumph in adversity, and demands a confrontation with the circumstances of poverty in a collapsing welfare state, and the oftentimes inequitable perceptions of disability and difference which permeate our social (and scientific) lives.

If facilitated communication is a practice meant to enable those who might otherwise go unheard to communicate with the assistance or support of others, then certainly we are all practitioners. As the various poetic invocations of the memoir demonstrate, your own voice is indelibly tied to the devices and inventive potentials of literature and poetry. In that spirit, I would like to conjure a philosophical voice which has augmented my own communication and summarizes my reactions to Reasonable People. This is a statement on pragmatist ethics which I admire for its particular willingness to substitute social and emotional relevancy for technical sophistication. “Moral development in the individual, and moral progress in the human species as a whole, is a matter of re-marking human selves so as to enlarge the variety of relationships which constitute those selves. […] Pragmatists think of moral progress as more like sewing together a very large, elaborate, polychrome quilt, than like getting a clearer vision of something true and deep. […]So it is best to think of moral progress as a matter of increasing sensitivity, increasing responsiveness to the needs of a larger and larger variety of people and things” (R. Rorty, Ethics without Principles, 1994).\n\nThe great achievement of Reasonable People is to confront social injustice through the life and actions of one family, without becoming politically sterile. The memoir inspires moral indignation and reasonable political expectations that we can all contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian society with efforts that are neither heroic nor unreasonable, but simply sensible individuals encouraged by compassion and interested in building a more creative and diverse social landscape which enriches our own lives. Americans are often ready to make ‘easy reading’ of memoirs such as Reasonable People, but the unique virtue of this work is that it denies its readers a packaged tale of triumph in adversity, and demands a confrontation with the circumstances of poverty in a collapsing welfare state, and the oftentimes inequitable perceptions of disability and difference which permeate our social (and scientific) lives. You will have to forgive the clumsiness of my evaluation and expression (as I lack any literary training), but Reasonable People is simply a beautiful act of impassioned love and rage.

I just finished it last night. Actually, I was so sucked in by it that it has been my companion every night for the past week. It is rare that I have the opportunity to respond to an author of a memoir who I know in "real life", so I hope you''ll indulge me. I figure you wrote over 400 pages so the least I can do is write a lengthy email.\r\n\r\nThe experience of reading was changed by my remembering of Gainesville, Grinnell, you, your tone of voice and brief references you made in class that were elaborated in the book (such as the story about the poem and Charlie''s stroller). I was even able to picture Emily and DJ (though I never met them formally, I saw them when I was out walking at Krumm one day so I at least have a sketchy image). All of this made the reading experience wholly different.\r\n\r\nI can forgive the GLAD trashbag reference because you quoted my favorite Annie Dillard essay (I keep a copy of it in my desk).\r\n\r\nIt is touching how you intermittently honor Emily in the book like a bird alighting on solid ground before flying off again. You make sure that we don''t forget her part.\r\n\r\nAt the end, when you discover that you don''t want DJ to focus only on trauma and the past and begin to be firm about establishing a different narrative for his life I was reminded of narrative psychotherapy (related, some might say, to constructivist therapy). It strikes me that you and DJ were practicing this kind of therapy. It''s attributed to a guy named White and if you haven''t heard of it you might find it interesting. It''s essentially about honoring people''s humanity by giving them the opportunity to "re-story" old, stuck narratives in a way that is more empowering for their present and future life. I was interested in many of your reflections on psychotherapy since I currently work as a therapist in private practice. (Not to worry- I also still work as a medical social worker with people who have end stage renal disease.)\r\n\r\nI positively cried my eyes out during the parts about Charlie. You write sadness well. To me, those sections are some of the strongest and most effective in the book.\r\n\r\nOf course, I took note of the handful of places where you touch on theology. We never discussed this but you had somewhat of a reputation at Grinnell as being anti-religion (my favorite quote that you uttered one day in class is this: "I don''t have antipathy toward religion, it just leaves me cold.") In the book, I sensed the primary theological theme as being discomfort/anger with the notion of a God who acts either as puppeteer or who refuses to intervene in suffering when he/she could.

As a ''northerner'' that has been in Texas for almost four years, the Fundamentalist Christians and their lack of sensistivity has been astounding. It is simply chosen ignorance and hypocrisy. I was raised as a Christian in the Lutheran Church, LCA.\r\n\r\nMy daughter is adopted. We traveled to a foreign country to find our perfect little bundle of ''special needs'' child. She was two when I first met her. As in the United States, children above six months of age have decreasing percentage chances of adoption. By age five, a child, particularly in an overseas orphanage such as my daughter''s, has a one percent chance of finding a forever family. My daughter was displaying autistic type tendencies, as they referred to her behaviors, at the time of her adoption. She also displays scars from physical beatings either with her birth mother the first six months of her life or with orphanage personnel. The overseas doctor was very concerned that we might not want to adopt her with her challenges. Many other families had met her and chose not to. She still has challenging days. What is most amusing is when people comment how ''normal'' my child appears. As if the rest of us are truly ''normal''! I love my child. Her originally labeled autistic type tendencies now are more so likely in another category of neurological. Now that she is has just reached age six, our adoption agency ''up north'' and other experts have recommended that her development is such that testing will now be able to guide us. Either way, she is my child. Yes, these children need our love, as well as we need theirs. My daughter has been the best that has ever happened to me. I''m sure you feel the same about your child. I try to educate those who do not understand what they are saying when they are aware of my daughter''s background. For those who would rather not be educated, I choose to leave them to their voluntary ignorance, in that is what they prefer and I have been things to do like spend time focusing on my child.\r\n\r\nI commend you on your attempt to educate the Dallas/Fort Worth and Texas area residents. I must say though that it is possibly an effort in futility. Now as a college professor, and prior as a corporate executive, I have experience in the workplace fighting discrimination issues, etc. Dallas/Forth Worth has been my most challenging audience to date.

If facilitated communication is a practice meant to enable those who might otherwise go unheard to communicate with the assistance or support of others, then certainly we are all practitioners. As the various poetic invocations of the memoir demonstrate, your own voice is indelibly tied to the devices and inventive potentials of literature and poetry. In that spirit, I would like to conjure a philosophical voice which has augmented my own communication and summarizes my reactions to Reasonable People. This is a statement on pragmatist ethics which I admire for its particular willingness to substitute social and emotional relevancy for technical sophistication. “Moral development in the individual, and moral progress in the human species as a whole, is a matter of re-marking human selves so as to enlarge the variety of relationships which constitute those selves. […] Pragmatists think of moral progress as more like sewing together a very large, elaborate, polychrome quilt, than like getting a clearer vision of something true and deep. […]So it is best to think of moral progress as a matter of increasing sensitivity, increasing responsiveness to the needs of a larger and larger variety of people and things” (R. Rorty, Ethics without Principles, 1994).\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of Reasonable People is to confront social injustice through the life and actions of one family, without becoming politically sterile. The memoir inspires moral indignation and reasonable political expectations that we can all contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian society with efforts that are neither heroic nor unreasonable, but simply sensible individuals encouraged by compassion and interested in building a more creative and diverse social landscape which enriches our own lives. Americans are often ready to make ‘easy reading’ of memoirs such as Reasonable People, but the unique virtue of this work is that it denies its readers a packaged tale of triumph in adversity, and demands a confrontation with the circumstances of poverty in a collapsing welfare state, and the oftentimes inequitable perceptions of disability and difference which permeate our social (and scientific) lives. You will have to forgive the clumsiness of my evaluation and expression (as I lack any literary training), but Reasonable People is simply a beautiful act of impassioned love and rage. You managed to capture the almost oppressive sense of hopelessness and frustration which you, Emily, and DJ at times faced, while simultaneously capturing the enduring love and hope which paradoxically filled those same moments.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to add a word to DJ. If his dream is to become a political freedom fighter, then he has certainly achieved more with respect to his aspirations than many of us can hope to do in a lifetime. In showing the courage to allow his story to be told, he has shown the determination and fearless spirit which it takes to inspire radical political action.

With John Proctor raging against the trial that would convict him of witchcraft, Judge Danforth was supposed to exclaim, "Do you doubt my probity?" But instead, the roly-poly adolescent playing him yelled, "Do you doubt my puberty?" which elicited tremendous guffaws from the audience. The kid''s puberty was indeed in doubt. Baby fat and a squeaky voice made it almost impossible to accept the high seriousness of the drama. With one slip, this famous American tragedy turned tragically comic. Even at the end of the play, as Proctor was being hanged and as Miller''s implied critique of McCarthyism resounded, some in the audience were still guffawing.\r\n\r\nI thought of this gaffe when my 16-year-old son, a sophomore with autism, asked on his talking computer, "Will I ever get to have sex?" "Yes," my wife and I responded, committed to the creative problem solving we''d practiced from the moment our adopted son arrived in diapers and carrying the label of profound mental retardation at the age of 6. That little boy is now a young man: He''s 5-foot-10; he''s shaving. He''s also a straight-A, honor-roll student at our local high school. He has appeared on CNN with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and given speeches all over the country on the importance of self-determination. What''s a little sex compared to the obstacles he''s already overcome? I mused.\r\n\r\nIn effect, my son was asking, "Do you doubt my puberty?" But for him, as for so many other people with cognitive differences, the issue isn''t humorous. When you consider the shame that people attach to disability generally and the near hysteria that greets disabled sex in particular, my son''s concern shouldn''t surprise anyone. Just two years ago, America learned that Arthur Miller fathered a boy with Down syndrome, a boy he abandoned at an institution and never told anyone about. Only at the end of his life did this defender of the politically oppressed bother to visit his son. When he did, he was reportedly shocked that the 40-year-old Daniel had a job and lived largely independently.\r\n\r\nA year earlier, the media reported on a girl whose parents had authorized the removal of her breast buds and uterus and the injection of high doses of estrogen to prevent puberty and keep her small. The parents thought it would be easier to care for Ashley, whom they dubbed the "Pillow Angel," when she was older, and a hospital ethics board approved this "growth attenuation" for "static encephalopathy." The hospital, however, violated state law by not submitting the procedure to court review. The public uproar was tremendous, and one of Ashley''s two doctors ended up committing suicide.\r\n\r\nMany supported the procedure, but an adult woman with "static encephalopathy," who communicates by pointing at a vertical letter board, criticized the "readiness with which Ashley''s parents, doctors and most commentators assumed they could make an accurate estimation of the understanding of a child without speech who has severely restricted movement." As the woman, Anne McDonald, explained, the presumption of a lack of intelligence governed their attitudes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we''ve come a long way from the incarceration, sterilization, and eugenics of the 20th century, but not far enough. The dream of full participation in life''s richness for those with cognitive differences remains just that: a dream. Who of us doesn''t want a job, a home and friends? Who of us doesn''t want a share of that sublime and affirming activity we call sex (or what my son at age 12 memorably termed "great feelings")? We need to stop behaving like hysterical Puritans and provide people with disabilities with rigorous sex education. Not only that but opportunities, even trained sexual facilitators, if need be. Kids with disabilities grow up. Let them look forward to what the rest of us look forward to. We can do this responsibly, ethically.\r\n\r\nA journalist covering the Arthur Miller story suggested that in the forsaken relationship with Daniel, Miller was "sitting on his greatest unwritten play." My own son just received a "Division I" rating in the state theater competition with a work about autism that he wrote and helped to direct. It''s called "Plotting Hope," and I like to think of it as filling a void that Miller simply couldn''t imagine.', 'A question for all: Do you doubt my puberty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '43-revision-4', '', '', '2010-08-18 09:57:54', '2010-08-18 16:57:54', '', 43, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/43-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

For this non-speaking boy with autism, abandoned at the age of three and literally tortured in foster care, anxiety remains his biggest challenge.\r\n\r\n"Your breathing would make me nervous," he wrote to his teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him. "Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write?" he remonstrated them. "I very much value teachers who give nice instructions breathing easily."\r\n\r\nIn contrast, he extolled his time in a regular classroom: "Easy, quiet breathing waits to hear my words, and respect grows. Awesome, caring teachers read my writing and reward me by writing back." It''s as if DJ, a sixth-grader, had transformed the primary, physical symptom of his anxiety -- heavy breathing -- into a political concept.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the amelioration of anxiety has been inexorably tied to the experience of inclusion: of being wanted by family, school, and community. "Breathing feels great now," he declared on his talking computer during an especially good stretch in the sixth grade. "Breathing feels kind of like joy. When I''m breathing easily, I''m sort of like respected kids."\r\n\r\nHow can respected adults breathe easily about autism? For one thing, we can promote inclusion as an opportunity to get to know autistic individuals. Such interaction would help to debunk the idea of a catastrophic disorder that precludes awareness of self and others. For too long scientists have terrorized us with this claim.\r\n\r\nFor another, we can devote more research money to improving the quality of life for people with autism. For every two studies on the cause, or causes, of autism, there ought to be at least one on the goal of autistic self-fulfillment. With richly rewarding lives as the norm, non-autistics might be less hysterical about finding a cure.\r\n\r\nDon''t get me wrong: autism presents significant, sometimes monumental, challenges. DJ, for example, is unable to speak, has sensory processing difficulties, and engages in repetitive behavior.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the boy who was labeled profoundly retarded when he came to live with us at the age of six is now a straight "A" student in a regular school, testing off the charts and using a computer to communicate. He''s also the most empathetic and politically conscious young person I know.\r\n\r\nI''m convinced that we can move forward with a vigorous research agenda while respecting the person with autism. But we have to make room for this difference in the world. We have to reduce the stigma attached to it. At the same time, we have to provide more support for parents who frequently find themselves at the ends of their ropes.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, DJ was asked to compose a paragraph about the American flag for an Elks Club writing contest. His paragraph went like this: "The great United States of America is breathtakingly not free. Equality is not sacred because not everyone has access to it. Free people treat my people, very smart people who type to communicate, as mindless.... The creators of everyone''s very important Declaration of Independence wasted their breath."\r\n\r\nHere was a boy demanding his place in America. I took note of the signature metaphor and pictured democracy itself in respiratory distress.\r\n\r\nRecently, DJ was much more sanguine -- and serene -- in an essay comparing the plight of his "people" with that of African Americans; he''d just studied the civil rights movement. "I imagine my words resembling dead Martin Luther King''s respectful vision," he typed.\r\n\r\nMight we neurotypicals mirror such equanimity when confronting the challenges of autism?\r\n\r\nRalph James Savarese is the author, with his son, of Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption (Other Press 2007).

It was a reasonable question in this age of narrow self-concern — far more reasonable, or at least more reasonably put, than many of the other questions we fielded.\r\n\r\nFor example, "Why don''t you have your own children?" a wealthy relative inquired, as if natural family-making were a kind of gated community it was best never to abandon. "You two have such good genes," she added. "Why waste them?"\r\n\r\nA colleague at work confronted me in the mailroom with this memorable gem: "Have you tried in-vitro?" She feared that we hadn''t availed ourselves of the many wondrous technologies that rescue infertile couples. "Wouldn''t that be better than adopting a child with a disability?" she asked, drawing out the word "disability." "God knows what that kid''s parents were doing when they conceived him."\r\n\r\n"We''re not infertile," I barked. "We have a relationship with the boy."\r\n\r\nMy wife, an autism expert, had offered his mother services, but as the woman found it increasingly difficult to care for her son and then dropped out of the picture altogether, we''d started spending time with him. His first communicative act with language, at age 3 — the sign for "more" — we''d taught him while tickling his belly.\r\n\r\nHe later made that sign in the emergency room of a hospital where he was brought after being beaten in foster care. Upon seeing us — we''d been called in to try to calm him — he stopped in his tracks, paused (as if to allow some associative chain to complete itself) and demanded obsessively to be tickled. I remember searching on his chest for unbruised patches among the purple, blue and black. He was that frantic in his quest for the familiar and, dare I say, for love.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I can''t believe how callous people were; the strange anxiety that adopting a child with a disability provoked. And the anxiety just kept coming. "Healthy white infants must be tough to get," a neighbor commented. No paragons of racial sensitivity, we were nevertheless appalled by the idea that we''d do anything to avoid adopting, say, a black child or a Latino one.\r\n\r\nAs offensive was the assumption that we must be devout Christians: hyperbolic, designated do-gooders with a joint eye firmly on some final prize. "God''s reserving a special place for you," we heard on more than one occasion, as if our son deserved pity and we were allowed neither our flaws nor a different understanding of social commitment. The journalist Adam Pertman, in his otherwise excellent book, "Adoption Nation," reproduces this logic exactly when he speaks of "children so challenging that only the most saintly among us would think [my italics] of tackling their behavioral and physical problems."\r\n\r\nDespite the stigma attached to "special-needs children," people do adopt these kids. And yet, many more Americans spend gobs of money on fertility treatments or travel to foreign countries to find their perfect little bundles. I''m haunted by something my son wrote after we taught him how to read and type on a computer: "I want you to be proud of me. I dream of that because in foster care I had no one." How many kids lie in bed at night and think something similar?\r\n\r\nThe physical and behavioral problems have been significant, at times even crushing. The last eight years have been devoted almost exclusively to my son''s welfare: literacy training, occupational therapy, relationship building, counseling for post-traumatic stress — the list goes on and on. But what strides he has made.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was still in diapers and said to be retarded when he came to live with us is now a straight-A student at our local middle school. He''s literally rewriting the common scripts of autism and "attachment disorder" (the broad diagnosis for the problems of abandoned and traumatized kids). These are hopeless scripts, unforgiving scripts in which the child can''t give back.\r\n\r\nMy son does, and others can as well. Recently, in response to my hip replacement, he typed on his computer, "I''m nervous because Dad has not brought me braces [his word for crutches]."

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(360, 1, '2010-08-26 13:26:45', '2010-08-26 20:26:45', 'As a freshman in high school, I had a bit part in a community-theater production of Arthur Miller''s "The Crucible." With John Proctor raging against the trial that would convict him of witchcraft, Judge Danforth was supposed to exclaim, "Do you doubt my probity?" But instead, the roly-poly adolescent playing him yelled, "Do you doubt my puberty?" which elicited tremendous guffaws from the audience. The kid''s puberty was indeed in doubt. Baby fat and a squeaky voice made it almost impossible to accept the high seriousness of the drama. With one slip, this famous American tragedy turned tragically comic. Even at the end of the play, as Proctor was being hanged and as Miller''s implied critique of McCarthyism resounded, some in the audience were still guffawing.\r\n\r\nI thought of this gaffe when my 16-year-old son, a sophomore with autism, asked on his talking computer, "Will I ever get to have sex?" "Yes," my wife and I responded, committed to the creative problem solving we''d practiced from the moment our adopted son arrived in diapers and carrying the label of profound mental retardation at the age of 6. That little boy is now a young man: He''s 5-foot-10; he''s shaving. He''s also a straight-A, honor-roll student at our local high school. He has appeared on CNN with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and given speeches all over the country on the importance of self-determination. What''s a little sex compared to the obstacles he''s already overcome? I mused.\r\n\r\nIn effect, my son was asking, "Do you doubt my puberty?" But for him, as for so many other people with cognitive differences, the issue isn''t humorous. When you consider the shame that people attach to disability generally and the near hysteria that greets disabled sex in particular, my son''s concern shouldn''t surprise anyone. Just two years ago, America learned that Arthur Miller fathered a boy with Down syndrome, a boy he abandoned at an institution and never told anyone about. Only at the end of his life did this defender of the politically oppressed bother to visit his son. When he did, he was reportedly shocked that the 40-year-old Daniel had a job and lived largely independently.\r\n\r\nA year earlier, the media reported on a girl whose parents had authorized the removal of her breast buds and uterus and the injection of high doses of estrogen to prevent puberty and keep her small. The parents thought it would be easier to care for Ashley, whom they dubbed the "Pillow Angel," when she was older, and a hospital ethics board approved this "growth attenuation" for "static encephalopathy." The hospital, however, violated state law by not submitting the procedure to court review. The public uproar was tremendous, and one of Ashley''s two doctors ended up committing suicide.\r\n\r\nMany supported the procedure, but an adult woman with "static encephalopathy," who communicates by pointing at a vertical letter board, criticized the "readiness with which Ashley''s parents, doctors and most commentators assumed they could make an accurate estimation of the understanding of a child without speech who has severely restricted movement." As the woman, Anne McDonald, explained, the presumption of a lack of intelligence governed their attitudes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we''ve come a long way from the incarceration, sterilization, and eugenics of the 20th century, but not far enough. The dream of full participation in life''s richness for those with cognitive differences remains just that: a dream. Who of us doesn''t want a job, a home and friends? Who of us doesn''t want a share of that sublime and affirming activity we call sex (or what my son at age 12 memorably termed "great feelings")? We need to stop behaving like hysterical Puritans and provide people with disabilities with rigorous sex education. Not only that but opportunities, even trained sexual facilitators, if need be. Kids with disabilities grow up. Let them look forward to what the rest of us look forward to. We can do this responsibly, ethically.\r\n\r\nA journalist covering the Arthur Miller story suggested that in the forsaken relationship with Daniel, Miller was "sitting on his greatest unwritten play." My own son just received a "Division I" rating in the state theater competition with a work about autism that he wrote and helped to direct. It''s called "Plotting Hope," and I like to think of it as filling a void that Miller simply couldn''t imagine.', 'A Question for All: Do You Doubt My Puberty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '43-revision-5', '', '', '2010-08-26 13:26:45', '2010-08-26 20:26:45', '', 43, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/43-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I worked on my dissertation, taught classes at UF, and looked after DJ; Emily continued to work at CARD and spent lots and lots of time at Liney.  During this year, DJ made significant communicative leaps.  His signing improved to the point that he could say, “I want to eat” or “I want to take a bath,” though it remained strictly utilitarian and very repetitive.  Issues with finger dexterity suggested that sophisticated signing might not be in DJ’s future.  While he recognized more and more signs, he couldn’t produce them himself, even after much practice.  We continued to cover our house—all of the objects in it—with sign diagrams, picture symbols, and words, especially words, immersing DJ in what experts call a “print-rich environment.”  We also pressed on with speech therapy and, of course, OT.\r\n\r\nIf the primary goal of kindergarten had been to acquaint DJ with the expectations, routines, and activities of a regular school, then the goal of first grade was to begin the long march to literacy.  Though Emily didn’t know whether he was a gestalt learner, she’d suspected he had great trouble deciphering spoken language and thus believed it pointless to teach phonics.  Instead, she focused on sight recognition, utilizing his cultivated familiarity with puzzles and his desire to close the system (as with toileting) to build alphabet, number, and word awareness.  The reading program DJ worked on began by asking him simply to find a word printed on the left hand side of the page in a grouping of, first, two, then, three, then, four, then five words on the right side of the page.  The words would be accompanied by picture symbols or diagrams.  “Point to same,” we’d tell DJ in sign, and he’d take the word on the left, which had Velcro on its back, and attach it to the proper word on the right.  Before he’d actually attach the word, we’d make sure it was correct by asking him to point to his answer.  A proponent of “error-free learning,” Emily believed that it was important to keep him from memorizing the wrong answer and to relieve the pressure of being right (especially for a kid with fragile self esteem who hadn’t yet secured his place in a regular classroom).  The physical act of velcroing the word to its partner closed the system in a definitive manner. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, DJ was correct only about thirty percent of the time, and so we’d have to ask him to reconsider.  “Find same,” we’d say over and over, and he’d point to something else.  Endless (and I mean endless) repetition accustomed him to English letters and letter groupings.  Seeing the corresponding picture and sign helped to connect these graphic symbols to the things they represented.  When we began, we had no idea if this literacy strategy would work or how far it would take us; we just knew that what had been tried previously hadn’t worked.  Early in the first grade, the Resource Room teacher at Liney saw that DJ was having success in matching words, and fairly soon she became one of DJ’s most ardent advocates.  In fact, when Mrs. Bollinger left to take the administrative post in the district, she assumed the PBS and IEP leadership role, problem solving creatively and intelligently.\r\n\r\nGetting DJ to focus continued to be a problem, but we were making progress there as well.  Having read a number of autobiographical accounts of autism, Emily advanced the theory of sensory input difficulties as a major impediment, perhaps the major impediment, to learning.  Lack of input, too much input, a system of sensory processing wildly out of whack—these were the issues confronting kids with autism, kids who couldn’t seem to focus.  At times, the everyday world was like a siren blaring in their ears or a fireworks display before their eyes.  At other times, a void: a blank, operating room white, with the Autist like a patient on a table who doesn’t feel a thing—a patient in search of his body.  The challenge was to tame the distractions the rest of us knew how to tune out and/or to provide the missing sensation.  Somehow we convinced the folks at Liney that DJ needed regular sensory-input breaks: moon-shoes, a mini-trampoline, brushing, swinging, walking.  You can’t imagine the look on the new principal’s face when the Resource Room teacher suggested that the courtyard outside the first grade classroom might be a good place for DJ’s trampoline.  Envisioning a fourteen-foot trampoline that only DJ could use, the principal seemed shocked.  “No, a much smaller one--like they use for aerobics,” the Resource Room teacher said, appreciating the principal’s concern.  That almost no one scoffed at these unconventional pedagogical methods spoke to how invested the school had become in DJ’s success.\r\n\r\nOnce DJ had mastered the task of matching words, we moved on to fill-in-the-blank sentences.  Again, we employed pictures to help convey the meaning of a sentence, focusing on one part of speech, one part of the sentence, at a time.  Here, “error-free learning” was even more important, as DJ, at least initially, couldn’t pick the proper word from the assembled word bank.  For a good long while, we simply modeled the right choice, conceiving of the exercise as intensive spelling and vocabulary training.  After we pointed out the correct answer, we’d have him attach it with Velcro to the blank in the sentence.  Over and over, we repeated this process, hoping that meaning might stick and that eventually syntactical relationships might become evident.  While we saw signs of improvement, the going was very slow indeed—slow and erratic, with tiny bursts of insight and knowledge consolidation, followed by inexplicable setbacks.   \r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, where he spent one period per day, DJ moved through a series of stations.  One involved the hand-over-hand tracing of his name or the execution of alphabet pages where he had to cut out a letter and glue it on the page and then color all of the pictures of the objects that began with that letter.  One was a puzzle of some sort.  Another was a picture with the shape of the corresponding word carved out.  DJ had to spell the word by putting the correct plastic letter in the correct cut out letter space.  This he could do errorlessly on his own, and then a device called “Leapfrog” would say the word out loud.  A fourth involved one-on-one reading with the Resource Room teacher.  Though DJ didn’t experience any genuinely explosive eureka moments, we felt as if we were laying a foundation: tediously, meticulously.  Yes, his concrete was taking longer to set, but we looked forward to helping him frame the sturdiest of structures.  It seemed as if a house was coming, or at least we thought it was.  By the end of the year, Kathy noticed that DJ was focusing on learning tasks more easily, beginning to recognize new vocabulary/spelling words by the third or fourth time they had practiced them, and moving around the school and Resource Room more independently.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn many respects, second grade was a continuation of first.  We added more words to DJ’s word banks (thereby giving him more choices) and, eventually, more blanks to his sentences.  We encouraged him to point as much as possible, making sure to correct him before he closed the system.  Where second grade differed from first was in the introduction of hand-over-hand typing.  He’d use a labeler to do his work, a portable machine that printed out full sentences that could then be stuck to a piece of paper.  Emily figured that DJ would likely continue to have finger dexterity problems and thus she believed that typing—not writing—would constitute his primary means of communication.  She also thought typing would serve as yet another way to expose him to print.  The keyboard would stabilize the location of letters and standardize them as well.  From a practical standpoint, the machine was very convenient—much, much better than the Velcro system, as the worksheets that comprised so much of elementary school life no longer required the same tedious preparation. \r\n\r\nIt’s important to underscore that at no time did we think we were practicing facilitated communication, that controversial communication technique from the 1990s in which someone supports the hand, wrist, or arm of a non-speaking person with autism as he or she types.  We knew that we were doing the typing, just as we knew back when we commenced the fill-in-the-blank exercises that we were answering the questions.  We sought simply to model every aspect of the exercise through repetition and full immersion.  We’d seen progress with the fill-in-the-blanks and, so, hypothesized that we might one day see progress with the typing.  When we eventually did see significant progress, we still didn’t call it FC—not because we were afraid to stir up controversy but because our path to success had been so atypical, involving years of practice and explicit literacy instruction before we even expected the kind of results normally associated with FC.  If, as the religiously inclined might propose, the average FC triumph was like the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, then ours was like the resurrection of Lazarus on the fourth or, rather, four hundredth day.  It wasn’t really a resurrection at all but a slow coming forth to communicative life, as if the cave in which Lazarus resided were several miles long and it had taken him years to limp out.  And yet, in emphasizing the gradual achievement of literacy, I need to make room for some sort of notion of a sudden, inconceivable burst—both with respect to the pace of DJ’s subsequent communicative achievement and, even more important, to the concomitant psychological awakening.  Only after DJ had been walking amongst us for months and months did we begin to speak of facilitated communication.\r\n\r\nWith the typing, we continued to follow the principle of error-free learning.  We’d read the fill-in-the-blank sentences aloud to DJ along with the possible answers and ask him to choose.  We wanted to work on his oral comprehension while we worked on literacy.  If DJ was wrong, we’d point to the correct answer, type it with him and then have him place it on the page.  We’d star those questions he got correct on his own.  If DJ pointed at four incorrect answers in a row, we assumed the information was too difficult for him and reverted to the cuing protocol used in the first grade.  When DJ’s classmates began writing simple sentences and very simple stories, we’d do a version of the same with fill-in-the-blank sentences and word banks comprised of equally acceptable answers.  This gave DJ a chance not only to complete writing assignments on his own but also to make choices—even if the choices he made he didn’t always understand.\r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, the Edmark reading program focused on nouns: find the yellow car, the green car, the small car, the large car.  After stabilizing the noun, it then stabilized the adjective: find the red car, the red apple, the red house, etc.  Instead of worrying about the names of different parts of speech, we emphasized practical application.  We took advantage of DJ’s ability to “find same,” breaking the category of “same” into smaller units of similarity and difference.  After lots of practice, he could identify the verb in a grouping of, say, apple, go, and purple.  In the Resource Room we began to leave three and four blanks in sentences or, for shorter sentences, to require DJ to assemble the entire sentence himself.  He had some success with these tasks.  By the end of second grade, DJ was able to stay in class with few, if no, breaks, provided that he was actively engaged.  He was able to do the various exercises described, with the exception of the sentence assembly, with a seventy-five percent accuracy rate.  He was also able, with minimal cuing, to use his Cheaptalk device, which Emily would load with lots of answer banks, to participate in class.\r\n\r\nWhat did DJ’s progress amount to?  Where were we?  We hadn’t the foggiest idea.  Could DJ move from rigid drilling, as in a foreign language course, to something like fluency?  Would the rigid drilling help us achieve literacy but paradoxically reinforce his autism?  Anyone even remotely familiar with autism knows about the infamous tics and obsessions.  Maybe DJ would perseverate on Edmark exercises, insisting on finding “the red car, the red apple, the red house,” over and over.  How to get him to the point of meaningfully expressive communication?  How to get him to talk about his life and the feelings we knew he had?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nBy April, Ms. Leathers, the Resource Room teacher, and Mrs. Lohman reported that DJ seemed to be moving their hands when typing.  He’d point independently to a word in his word bank and then initiate the typing procedure.  They felt him guiding their hands to the appropriate keys.  Suddenly, he was able to read a story and complete six to eight worksheets on it.  The questions asked DJ to pick out relevant information: the color of the car, for example, or location of the hot air balloon.  For the first time, DJ was answering “wh” questions with complete accuracy.  Because we saw DJ first pointing to the correct answer in his word bank, we didn’t doubt for a second that he was guiding Ms. Leathers’ or Mrs. Lohman’s hands when typing, but we didn’t make a big deal of it.  We focused on the cognitive accomplishment, and, familiar with his finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination problems, simply assumed that DJ needed this kind of physical help. \r\n\r\nAgain, we didn’t call this help facilitated communication, neither privately with each other nor publicly at school or in the community, though that’s what it was.  It didn’t occur to us to ask DJ questions unrelated to the worksheets—about what he wanted to eat, for instance, or what he was thinking.  I can’t entirely explain why, especially since I’d made such a fuss at his first IEP about including the goal of asking questions about his life.  We were locked into our routine of using sign and pictures to determine DJ’s needs and using the labeler to work on his literacy skills.  Perhaps we’d grown too accustomed to the absence of more sophisticated expressive communication from DJ, underestimating what might have been possible right—or should I say, write—then.  We were still relying on fill-in-the-blanks, however, and we honestly didn’t think he could compose an entire sentence on his own.  Still, we could have set up a worksheet that said: I feel a) sad, b) happy, or c) mad, and the fact that we didn’t bothers me to this day.  His most passionate advocates were probably holding him back.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, we noticed that DJ was showing more interest in his regular ed math teacher’s instruction than in the basic addition/subtraction money worksheets we were having him do with his aide.  He literally seemed to crane his neck to see what was being written on the blackboard instead of concentrating on what was immediately in front of him.  Early on, we’d decided to focus exclusively on literacy and had only just begun to give him math materials.  Here, too, he shot forward—like some sort of spaceship assuming warp speed.  He’d clearly apprehended the concept of place value on his own, for he started solving more complicated problems, embarking, it seemed, on a daring space walk in the thin universe of numbers.  At the I.E.P in May, Ms. Leathers and Mrs. Lohman reported DJ’s progress and asked sheepishly if we’d ever consider just trying him out in the regular math curriculum.  For the first time, school personnel were setting the bar higher for DJ than we had.  It was quite a moment.  We found it ironic that the subject we’d entirely neglected might turn out to be DJ’s strongest.  His teachers for the following year, Mr. Abarr and Ms. Louden, were present at the meeting.  Though apprehensive about the experience that lay ahead, they were open to it, and they asked what they could do to help.  “Have your lesson plans ready in advance and expect DJ to actively participate in your classes,” Emily told them.\r\n\r\nWe spent the summer in Hilton Head at Em’s parents, where Emily continued to work with DJ on his alternative reading program, which she’d borrowed from the school.  DJ looked forward to his daily reading lessons, completing five to six worksheets a day and taking only two days to complete each story.  On a short trip back to Florida, we had lunch with our friends the Rifkins, who have a son with autism.  Just home from a weeklong intensive seminar on using technology to access literacy for kids with autism, Margo inspired us to do more with computers.  We planned to apply for a state-funded Gemini: a high-powered Mac with touch-screen and voice capabilities that cost about seven thousand dollars.  DJ needed to be able to “speak” more than the pre-recorded messages on his Cheaptalk would allow.\r\n\r\nThe week before school began, he experienced his first expressive breakthrough.  Up until this point, all of his worksheets involved either fill-in-the-blank comprehension tasks or sequencing tasks, not open-ended questions.  Emily and DJ had been reading the program’s version of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” and they had arrived at the conclusion of the story where Jack and his mother sit enjoying their triumph.  The last question on the last page surprised—and worried—Emily.  Instead of asking for factual information from the story, it asked the student to imagine what the Mom might be thinking.  At this point, DJ was still conveying his answers by pointing to words in word banks and adhering them to the page in the appropriate place.  How could he possibly answer this question? Emily thought.  She considered either skipping it or offering three valid ideas of her own from which he might choose.  Before she could decide, DJ picked up his labeler and turned it on (something she’d never seen him do before).  He took Emily’s hand and purposefully guided it from letter to letter until he had typed out: “where a dad.”  The incorrect grammar, the obvious way in which this statement reflected his own life experience, and the fact that Emily had no idea what he was going to type (in the past, they’d simply typed his already identified answer) stopped her dead in her tracks.  With tears in her eyes, she called me into the room and narrated for me what had just happened.  I was dumbfounded.  “Where a Dad?”—an exceedingly relevant question from a boy whose family life had been so unstable.  “Wow, DJ!” I exclaimed, “wow!”\r\n\r\nA week later, after he’d correctly solved a math problem, the worksheet asked him to explain his answer.  To which DJ replied, once again picking up his labeler and taking hold of Emily’s hand, “becuse just.”  So, DJ understood colloquial English as well, except he’d transposed the two words, producing that brother-from-another-planet translation effect that seemed like poetry.  The fall was one long whirr of accomplishment.  “What is a subway?” “subway is underbus,” DJ answered, either coining his own clever definition or simply failing to hit the space bar on the labeler.  “What is a pyramid?”  “opyramid us [is] sand triwangle.”  This answer floored Emily and me—once, of course, we’d accustomed ourselves to the characteristic errors in his typing: in particular, hitting the key next to the one he wanted.  We’d encountered these errors before, but now we had no idea what he was going to say.  “A sand triangle” seemed as good a short definition of a pyramid as I’d ever come across; you could tell it was the product of a visual thinker—almost painterly its minimalist, compositional emphasis.  “What is a mummy?”  “kijng tut,” DJ answered.  “What is a capital?”  “big ciuty.”  “What is a festival?  “uit iws sa pwarty.”  “What are monuments?”  “detad people live there.” \r\n\r\nHow did DJ know the answers to these questions?  Had he been reading before we knew he was reading--not only reading but thinking, processing, refining?  His answers suggested something far different from rote memorization or rigid regurgitation: the expected mastery of someone autistic.  Hyperbole can’t do justice to our excitement, our awe, at DJ’s achievements.  Our friend Judy Barber, the district’s speech/language person, said in disbelief, “This isn’t supposed to be happening.  The kid isn’t falling farther and farther behind; he’s catching up!”  As excited as we were, we consciously decided not to bombard DJ with questions about his life.  Before, we’d failed to move quickly enough; now we wanted to focus on integrating the labeler into everyday routines, careful about overwhelming him emotionally.  But what was he thinking?  I had to resist handing over the stacks and stacks of pennies I’d saved for precisely this moment—a whole piggy bank’s worth to make up for lost time.  We’d let him choose when he wanted to weigh in on his past or present.  He seemed to need to get used to this new ability or, if not the ability itself, the experience of reciprocal exchange in a non-school or school-related setting.  He needed to get used to having unscripted conversations.  Though he appeared genuinely pleased by his accomplishments, he also appeared to be more nervous than usual, edgier, at times even frantic.\r\n\r\nBy mid-fall, DJ was doing regular fourth-grade math, marveling everyone.  On his first test he received a “B-,” but after that, nothing but “A”s.  Mr. Abarr had started DJ out on a calculator but very quickly realized that he was doing the problems in his head.  With a 100s chart he could simply point to the answer and then with assistance write it and place it on the page.  One day in language arts, at the beginning of a unit on the Titanic disaster, when Miss Louden was trying to determine the kids’ familiarity with the event, DJ typed out, “There were rich people on the boat.  There were poor people down below.  I was poor person once.”  (It’s one of the few things DJ’s typed that I don’t have, so I can’t reproduce his characteristic typos, but I saw the page and memorized the remark.)  Everyone was stunned by what DJ knew of the less romanticized version of the incident and how he’d identified with the ship’s least fortunate travelers.  When Miss. Louden asked the class what it would have been like to be a passenger on the Titanic, DJ typed, “Scared to die.” \r\n\r\nHow to account for a neurologically disabled fourth-grader with both class and existential consciousness?  How did DJ know these things?  How, with almost no training in math, could he do complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems in his head?  How?  How?  How?  How?  Later, when I’d start investigating this phenomenon, I’d discover that nobody really had an adequate theory beyond a notion of the child with autism somehow storing information (without exactly understanding it) and accessing it once he or she had come to communicative life.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThe day after Christmas, as I was preparing to leave for the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, Emily had a conversation with DJ on his laptop.  DJ had awakened at three in the morning and hadn’t been able to fall back to sleep.  Em’s folks, who had purchased the laptop for DJ when it became clear that the more powerful Mac would take months to get and that he really needed something more portable anyway, were sitting in the living room watching the conversation unfold.  Throughout the fall, they’d heard about DJ’s amazing progress but now they were getting to see it for themselves.\r\n\r\n“What woke you up this morning?” Emily asked.\r\n\r\n“adr  A dreammmmmm,” DJ typed.\r\n\r\n“About what?  Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“i dont know,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“My dream was about __________.”  Emily hoped that the fill-in-the-blank procedure might help him to answer.\r\n\r\n“a saaaad nityes”\r\n\r\n“Your dream was about a sad night?” she asked.  “What made the night sad?”\r\n\r\n“hdeerd heard     hide   deaddddddddddddddddd,”  DJ typed.  He had a habit of depressing keys and watching the computer reproduce the letters endlessly.  But DJ was also becoming upset, and when he was upset his typing faltered more than usual.\r\n\r\n“What was dead?”\r\n\r\n“giiiiirl,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Did you know her?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“What was the girl’s name?”\r\n\r\n“eklki,” he typed.\r\n\r\n“Sister Ellie?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“In real life sister Ellie is OK.  She lives in the Northeast,” Emily explained.  “Would you like to   write    talk    see    her?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“se33e,” he answered, letting out a loud shriek and starting to cry.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember skating and swinging with her?” Emily possessed unfailing judgment, and she’d clearly decided this was the moment to pursue the past.\r\n\r\n“ues,” DJ replied.\r\n\r\n“Ellie is very nice.”\r\n\r\n“when you were giiomg giuither [going get her],” DJ typed, now sobbing.  So, he knew I was traveling to the Northeast and thought somehow I might return with his sister.\r\n\r\n“You miss Ellie.  She loves you very much.”\r\n\r\n“yesw.”\r\n\r\n“when you ftherrrrrrrrrrrrff,”\r\n\r\n“When you find her?” Emily clarified.\r\n\r\n“findhergoinggither,” DJ typed insistently.   If the house were a mine shaft, we were all falling through it—Emily, DJ, Rachel, Phil, and I.  As impressive as the demonstration of cognitive competence had been, it was DJ’s heart that moved us most, his commitment to his sister, confirming what we’d always known: he missed her terribly.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas, DJ had produced his first story—his first sustained piece—about Frosty the Snowman and his pal Jimmy.  The story concluded with the following lines, and we thought of them again when DJ inquired about his sister.  If the story seems more composed than his customary communication, it’s because he worked on it endlessly.  Every element of it is his; Emily and I simply asked him if a given word or sentence was correct, and slowly but surely, he came up with this:\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the dock, standing and looking at the stars.  They turned and ran away.  They flew home.  They hugged, then waved goodbye.  They were sad.\r\nJimmy is dreaming about Frosty.  He is sad because Frosty i melting.  Jimmy is going to miss his friend Frosty.\r\n\r\nThe deep longing in these utterances and their obvious resonance with DJ’s life had stunned us.  I was particularly impressed by the syntax of the first line (a construction I’d been trying to teach my creative writing students).  It fixed the two characters on the dock in a posture of earnest contemplation, the way that an image in a poem might.  “What’s the meaning of it all?”  “Why is there loss?” the story inquired, half-expecting the stars to provide an answer.\r\n\r\n     Miss Louden conducted a creative writing workshop with her class, and one of the students responded to DJ’s story with a suggestion: in effect, that the problem of Frosty’s melting ought to be introduced earlier in the narrative.  DJ went bananas, screaming, hitting his head.  When Mrs. Lohman walked him out of the classroom and calmed him down, he typed on the computer, “dont want yelp [help] its my story.”  Even Mrs. Lohman, who had been struck, delighted in the pride DJ was showing in his work.  Emily joked that DJ took after his father.  While getting an MFA in poetry writing, I’d found receiving criticism similarly unbearable.\r\n\r\n     It had taken DJ forever to write the story.  The one-finger typing, the autistic fading in and out, the process of asking for clarifications and corrections, the multiple drafts—all of it made for very slow going.  Miss Louden and Mr. Abarr were terrific about granting extensions.  They were terrific in general, waiting for us at the door when we picked DJ up to tell us about his latest accomplishment.  They always had their lesson plans ready well in advance so that Emily could do the modifications.  Mr. Abarr worked with DJ sometimes one-on one, as did Miss Louden.  Miss Louden learned lots of useful sign language, incorporating it into the daily routine.  She had the class, for example, sign the “Pledge of Allegiance” each morning.  She also used the finger alphabet in spelling exercises.  Both frequently called on DJ in class.  For the first time in Iowa, he seemed like a fully active participant in his regular ed classes.', 'Excerpt', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'excerpt', '', '', '2010-08-27 13:34:21', '2010-08-27 20:34:21', '', 47, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/', 0, 'page', '', 0);

I worked on my dissertation, taught classes at UF, and looked after DJ; Emily continued to work at CARD and spent lots and lots of time at Liney.  During this year, DJ made significant communicative leaps.  His signing improved to the point that he could say, “I want to eat” or “I want to take a bath,” though it remained strictly utilitarian and very repetitive.  Issues with finger dexterity suggested that sophisticated signing might not be in DJ’s future.  While he recognized more and more signs, he couldn’t produce them himself, even after much practice.  We continued to cover our house—all of the objects in it—with sign diagrams, picture symbols, and words, especially words, immersing DJ in what experts call a “print-rich environment.”  We also pressed on with speech therapy and, of course, OT.\n\nIf the primary goal of kindergarten had been to acquaint DJ with the expectations, routines, and activities of a regular school, then the goal of first grade was to begin the long march to literacy.  Though Emily didn’t know whether he was a gestalt learner, she’d suspected he had great trouble deciphering spoken language and thus believed it pointless to teach phonics.  Instead, she focused on sight recognition, utilizing his cultivated familiarity with puzzles and his desire to close the system (as with toileting) to build alphabet, number, and word awareness.  The reading program DJ worked on began by asking him simply to find a word printed on the left hand side of the page in a grouping of, first, two, then, three, then, four, then five words on the right side of the page.  The words would be accompanied by picture symbols or diagrams.  “Point to same,” we’d tell DJ in sign, and he’d take the word on the left, which had Velcro on its back, and attach it to the proper word on the right.  Before he’d actually attach the word, we’d make sure it was correct by asking him to point to his answer.  A proponent of “error-free learning,” Emily believed that it was important to keep him from memorizing the wrong answer and to relieve the pressure of being right (especially for a kid with fragile self esteem who hadn’t yet secured his place in a regular classroom).  The physical act of velcroing the word to its partner closed the system in a definitive manner. \n\nAt the beginning, DJ was correct only about thirty percent of the time, and so we’d have to ask him to reconsider.  “Find same,” we’d say over and over, and he’d point to something else.  Endless (and I mean endless) repetition accustomed him to English letters and letter groupings.  Seeing the corresponding picture and sign helped to connect these graphic symbols to the things they represented.  When we began, we had no idea if this literacy strategy would work or how far it would take us; we just knew that what had been tried previously hadn’t worked.  Early in the first grade, the Resource Room teacher at Liney saw that DJ was having success in matching words, and fairly soon she became one of DJ’s most ardent advocates.  In fact, when Mrs. Bollinger left to take the administrative post in the district, she assumed the PBS and IEP leadership role, problem solving creatively and intelligently.\n\nGetting DJ to focus continued to be a problem, but we were making progress there as well.  Having read a number of autobiographical accounts of autism, Emily advanced the theory of sensory input difficulties as a major impediment, perhaps the major impediment, to learning.  Lack of input, too much input, a system of sensory processing wildly out of whack—these were the issues confronting kids with autism, kids who couldn’t seem to focus.  At times, the everyday world was like a siren blaring in their ears or a fireworks display before their eyes.  At other times, a void: a blank, operating room white, with the Autist like a patient on a table who doesn’t feel a thing—a patient in search of his body.  The challenge was to tame the distractions the rest of us knew how to tune out and/or to provide the missing sensation.  Somehow we convinced the folks at Liney that DJ needed regular sensory-input breaks: moon-shoes, a mini-trampoline, brushing, swinging, walking.  You can’t imagine the look on the new principal’s face when the Resource Room teacher suggested that the courtyard outside the first grade classroom might be a good place for DJ’s trampoline.  Envisioning a fourteen-foot trampoline that only DJ could use, the principal seemed shocked.  “No, a much smaller one--like they use for aerobics,” the Resource Room teacher said, appreciating the principal’s concern.  That almost no one scoffed at these unconventional pedagogical methods spoke to how invested the school had become in DJ’s success.\n\nOnce DJ had mastered the task of matching words, we moved on to fill-in-the-blank sentences.  Again, we employed pictures to help convey the meaning of a sentence, focusing on one part of speech, one part of the sentence, at a time.  Here, “error-free learning” was even more important, as DJ, at least initially, couldn’t pick the proper word from the assembled word bank.  For a good long while, we simply modeled the right choice, conceiving of the exercise as intensive spelling and vocabulary training.  After we pointed out the correct answer, we’d have him attach it with Velcro to the blank in the sentence.  Over and over, we repeated this process, hoping that meaning might stick and that eventually syntactical relationships might become evident.  While we saw signs of improvement, the going was very slow indeed—slow and erratic, with tiny bursts of insight and knowledge consolidation, followed by inexplicable setbacks.   \n\nIn the Resource Room, where he spent one period per day, DJ moved through a series of stations.  One involved the hand-over-hand tracing of his name or the execution of alphabet pages where he had to cut out a letter and glue it on the page and then color all of the pictures of the objects that began with that letter.  One was a puzzle of some sort.  Another was a picture with the shape of the corresponding word carved out.  DJ had to spell the word by putting the correct plastic letter in the correct cut out letter space.  This he could do errorlessly on his own, and then a device called “Leapfrog” would say the word out loud.  A fourth involved one-on-one reading with the Resource Room teacher.  Though DJ didn’t experience any genuinely explosive eureka moments, we felt as if we were laying a foundation: tediously, meticulously.  Yes, his concrete was taking longer to set, but we looked forward to helping him frame the sturdiest of structures.  It seemed as if a house was coming, or at least we thought it was.  By the end of the year, Kathy noticed that DJ was focusing on learning tasks more easily, beginning to recognize new vocabulary/spelling words by the third or fourth time they had practiced them, and moving around the school and Resource Room more independently.\n\n<hr>\n\nIn many respects, second grade was a continuation of first.  We added more words to DJ’s word banks (thereby giving him more choices) and, eventually, more blanks to his sentences.  We encouraged him to point as much as possible, making sure to correct him before he closed the system.  Where second grade differed from first was in the introduction of hand-over-hand typing.  He’d use a labeler to do his work, a portable machine that printed out full sentences that could then be stuck to a piece of paper.  Emily figured that DJ would likely continue to have finger dexterity problems and thus she believed that typing—not writing—would constitute his primary means of communication.  She also thought typing would serve as yet another way to expose him to print.  The keyboard would stabilize the location of letters and standardize them as well.  From a practical standpoint, the machine was very convenient—much, much better than the Velcro system, as the worksheets that comprised so much of elementary school life no longer required the same tedious preparation. \n\nIt’s important to underscore that at no time did we think we were practicing facilitated communication, that controversial communication technique from the 1990s in which someone supports the hand, wrist, or arm of a non-speaking person with autism as he or she types.  We knew that we were doing the typing, just as we knew back when we commenced the fill-in-the-blank exercises that we were answering the questions.  We sought simply to model every aspect of the exercise through repetition and full immersion.  We’d seen progress with the fill-in-the-blanks and, so, hypothesized that we might one day see progress with the typing.  When we eventually did see significant progress, we still didn’t call it FC—not because we were afraid to stir up controversy but because our path to success had been so atypical, involving years of practice and explicit literacy instruction before we even expected the kind of results normally associated with FC.  If, as the religiously inclined might propose, the average FC triumph was like the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, then ours was like the resurrection of Lazarus on the fourth or, rather, four hundredth day.  It wasn’t really a resurrection at all but a slow coming forth to communicative life, as if the cave in which Lazarus resided were several miles long and it had taken him years to limp out.  And yet, in emphasizing the gradual achievement of literacy, I need to make room for some sort of notion of a sudden, inconceivable burst—both with respect to the pace of DJ’s subsequent communicative achievement and, even more important, to the concomitant psychological awakening.  Only after DJ had been walking amongst us for months and months did we begin to speak of facilitated communication.\n\nWith the typing, we continued to follow the principle of error-free learning.  We’d read the fill-in-the-blank sentences aloud to DJ along with the possible answers and ask him to choose.  We wanted to work on his oral comprehension while we worked on literacy.  If DJ was wrong, we’d point to the correct answer, type it with him and then have him place it on the page.  We’d star those questions he got correct on his own.  If DJ pointed at four incorrect answers in a row, we assumed the information was too difficult for him and reverted to the cuing protocol used in the first grade.  When DJ’s classmates began writing simple sentences and very simple stories, we’d do a version of the same with fill-in-the-blank sentences and word banks comprised of equally acceptable answers.  This gave DJ a chance not only to complete writing assignments on his own but also to make choices—even if the choices he made he didn’t always understand.\n\nIn the Resource Room, the Edmark reading program focused on nouns: find the yellow car, the green car, the small car, the large car.  After stabilizing the noun, it then stabilized the adjective: find the red car, the red apple, the red house, etc.  Instead of worrying about the names of different parts of speech, we emphasized practical application.  We took advantage of DJ’s ability to “find same,” breaking the category of “same” into smaller units of similarity and difference.  After lots of practice, he could identify the verb in a grouping of, say, apple, go, and purple.  In the Resource Room we began to leave three and four blanks in sentences or, for shorter sentences, to require DJ to assemble the entire sentence himself.  He had some success with these tasks.  By the end of second grade, DJ was able to stay in class with few, if no, breaks, provided that he was actively engaged.  He was able to do the various exercises described, with the exception of the sentence assembly, with a seventy-five percent accuracy rate.  He was also able, with minimal cuing, to use his Cheaptalk device, which Emily would load with lots of answer banks, to participate in class.\n\nWhat did DJ’s progress amount to?  Where were we?  We hadn’t the foggiest idea.  Could DJ move from rigid drilling, as in a foreign language course, to something like fluency?  Would the rigid drilling help us achieve literacy but paradoxically reinforce his autism?  Anyone even remotely familiar with autism knows about the infamous tics and obsessions.  Maybe DJ would perseverate on Edmark exercises, insisting on finding “the red car, the red apple, the red house,” over and over.  How to get him to the point of meaningfully expressive communication?  How to get him to talk about his life and the feelings we knew he had?\n\n<hr>\n\nBy April, Ms. Leathers, the Resource Room teacher, and Mrs. Lohman reported that DJ seemed to be moving their hands when typing.  He’d point independently to a word in his word bank and then initiate the typing procedure.  They felt him guiding their hands to the appropriate keys.  Suddenly, he was able to read a story and complete six to eight worksheets on it.  The questions asked DJ to pick out relevant information: the color of the car, for example, or location of the hot air balloon.  For the first time, DJ was answering “wh” questions with complete accuracy.  Because we saw DJ first pointing to the correct answer in his word bank, we didn’t doubt for a second that he was guiding Ms. Leathers’ or Mrs. Lohman’s hands when typing, but we didn’t make a big deal of it.  We focused on the cognitive accomplishment, and, familiar with his finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination problems, simply assumed that DJ needed this kind of physical help. \n\nAgain, we didn’t call this help facilitated communication, neither privately with each other nor publicly at school or in the community, though that’s what it was.  It didn’t occur to us to ask DJ questions unrelated to the worksheets—about what he wanted to eat, for instance, or what he was thinking.  I can’t entirely explain why, especially since I’d made such a fuss at his first IEP about including the goal of asking questions about his life.  We were locked into our routine of using sign and pictures to determine DJ’s needs and using the labeler to work on his literacy skills.  Perhaps we’d grown too accustomed to the absence of more sophisticated expressive communication from DJ, underestimating what might have been possible right—or should I say, write—then.  We were still relying on fill-in-the-blanks, however, and we honestly didn’t think he could compose an entire sentence on his own.  Still, we could have set up a worksheet that said: I feel a) sad, b) happy, or c) mad, and the fact that we didn’t bothers me to this day.  His most passionate advocates were probably holding him back.\n\nAbout this time, we noticed that DJ was showing more interest in his regular ed math teacher’s instruction than in the basic addition/subtraction money worksheets we were having him do with his aide.  He literally seemed to crane his neck to see what was being written on the blackboard instead of concentrating on what was immediately in front of him.  Early on, we’d decided to focus exclusively on literacy and had only just begun to give him math materials.  Here, too, he shot forward—like some sort of spaceship assuming warp speed.  He’d clearly apprehended the concept of place value on his own, for he started solving more complicated problems, embarking, it seemed, on a daring space walk in the thin universe of numbers.  At the I.E.P in May, Ms. Leathers and Mrs. Lohman reported DJ’s progress and asked sheepishly if we’d ever consider just trying him out in the regular math curriculum.  For the first time, school personnel were setting the bar higher for DJ than we had.  It was quite a moment.  We found it ironic that the subject we’d entirely neglected might turn out to be DJ’s strongest.  His teachers for the following year, Mr. Abarr and Ms. Louden, were present at the meeting.  Though apprehensive about the experience that lay ahead, they were open to it, and they asked what they could do to help.  “Have your lesson plans ready in advance and expect DJ to actively participate in your classes,” Emily told them.\n\nWe spent the summer in Hilton Head at Em’s parents, where Emily continued to work with DJ on his alternative reading program, which she’d borrowed from the school.  DJ looked forward to his daily reading lessons, completing five to six worksheets a day and taking only two days to complete each story.  On a short trip back to Florida, we had lunch with our friends the Rifkins, who have a son with autism.  Just home from a weeklong intensive seminar on using technology to access literacy for kids with autism, Margo inspired us to do more with computers.  We planned to apply for a state-funded Gemini: a high-powered Mac with touch-screen and voice capabilities that cost about seven thousand dollars.  DJ needed to be able to “speak” more than the pre-recorded messages on his Cheaptalk would allow.\n\nThe week before school began, he experienced his first expressive breakthrough.  Up until this point, all of his worksheets involved either fill-in-the-blank comprehension tasks or sequencing tasks, not open-ended questions.  Emily and DJ had been reading the program’s version of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” and they had arrived at the conclusion of the story where Jack and his mother sit enjoying their triumph.  The last question on the last page surprised—and worried—Emily.  Instead of asking for factual information from the story, it asked the student to imagine what the Mom might be thinking.  At this point, DJ was still conveying his answers by pointing to words in word banks and adhering them to the page in the appropriate place.  How could he possibly answer this question? Emily thought.  She considered either skipping it or offering three valid ideas of her own from which he might choose.  Before she could decide, DJ picked up his labeler and turned it on (something she’d never seen him do before).  He took Emily’s hand and purposefully guided it from letter to letter until he had typed out: “where a dad.”  The incorrect grammar, the obvious way in which this statement reflected his own life experience, and the fact that Emily had no idea what he was going to type (in the past, they’d simply typed his already identified answer) stopped her dead in her tracks.  With tears in her eyes, she called me into the room and narrated for me what had just happened.  I was dumbfounded.  “Where a Dad?”—an exceedingly relevant question from a boy whose family life had been so unstable.  “Wow, DJ!” I exclaimed, “wow!”\n\nA week later, after he’d correctly solved a math problem, the worksheet asked him to explain his answer.  To which DJ replied, once again picking up his labeler and taking hold of Emily’s hand, “becuse just.”  So, DJ understood colloquial English as well, except he’d transposed the two words, producing that brother-from-another-planet translation effect that seemed like poetry.  The fall was one long whirr of accomplishment.  “What is a subway?” “subway is underbus,” DJ answered, either coining his own clever definition or simply failing to hit the space bar on the labeler.  “What is a pyramid?”  “opyramid us [is] sand triwangle.”  This answer floored Emily and me—once, of course, we’d accustomed ourselves to the characteristic errors in his typing: in particular, hitting the key next to the one he wanted.  We’d encountered these errors before, but now we had no idea what he was going to say.  “A sand triangle” seemed as good a short definition of a pyramid as I’d ever come across; you could tell it was the product of a visual thinker—almost painterly its minimalist, compositional emphasis.  “What is a mummy?”  “kijng tut,” DJ answered.  “What is a capital?”  “big ciuty.”  “What is a festival?  “uit iws sa pwarty.”  “What are monuments?”  “detad people live there.” \n\nHow did DJ know the answers to these questions?  Had he been reading before we knew he was reading--not only reading but thinking, processing, refining?  His answers suggested something far different from rote memorization or rigid regurgitation: the expected mastery of someone autistic.  Hyperbole can’t do justice to our excitement, our awe, at DJ’s achievements.  Our friend Judy Barber, the district’s speech/language person, said in disbelief, “This isn’t supposed to be happening.  The kid isn’t falling farther and farther behind; he’s catching up!”  As excited as we were, we consciously decided not to bombard DJ with questions about his life.  Before, we’d failed to move quickly enough; now we wanted to focus on integrating the labeler into everyday routines, careful about overwhelming him emotionally.  But what was he thinking?  I had to resist handing over the stacks and stacks of pennies I’d saved for precisely this moment—a whole piggy bank’s worth to make up for lost time.  We’d let him choose when he wanted to weigh in on his past or present.  He seemed to need to get used to this new ability or, if not the ability itself, the experience of reciprocal exchange in a non-school or school-related setting.  He needed to get used to having unscripted conversations.  Though he appeared genuinely pleased by his accomplishments, he also appeared to be more nervous than usual, edgier, at times even frantic.\n\nBy mid-fall, DJ was doing regular fourth-grade math, marveling everyone.  On his first test he received a “B-,” but after that, nothing but “A”s.  Mr. Abarr had started DJ out on a calculator but very quickly realized that he was doing the problems in his head.  With a 100s chart he could simply point to the answer and then with assistance write it and place it on the page.  One day in language arts, at the beginning of a unit on the Titanic disaster, when Miss Louden was trying to determine the kids’ familiarity with the event, DJ typed out, “There were rich people on the boat.  There were poor people down below.  I was poor person once.”  (It’s one of the few things DJ’s typed that I don’t have, so I can’t reproduce his characteristic typos, but I saw the page and memorized the remark.)  Everyone was stunned by what DJ knew of the less romanticized version of the incident and how he’d identified with the ship’s least fortunate travelers.  When Miss. Louden asked the class what it would have been like to be a passenger on the Titanic, DJ typed, “Scared to die.” \n\nHow to account for a neurologically disabled fourth-grader with both class and existential consciousness?  How did DJ know these things?  How, with almost no training in math, could he do complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems in his head?  How?  How?  How?  How?  Later, when I’d start investigating this phenomenon, I’d discover that nobody really had an adequate theory beyond a notion of the child with autism somehow storing information (without exactly understanding it) and accessing it once he or she had come to communicative life.\n\n<hr>\n\nThe day after Christmas, as I was preparing to leave for the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, Emily had a conversation with DJ on his laptop.  DJ had awakened at three in the morning and hadn’t been able to fall back to sleep.  Em’s folks, who had purchased the laptop for DJ when it became clear that the more powerful Mac would take months to get and that he really needed something more portable anyway, were sitting in the living room watching the conversation unfold.  Throughout the fall, they’d heard about DJ’s amazing progress but now they were getting to see it for themselves.\n\n“What woke you up this morning?” Emily asked.\n\n“adr  A dreammmmmm,” DJ typed.\n\n“About what?  Do you remember?”\n\n“i dont know,” he replied.\n\n“My dream was about __________.”  Emily hoped that the fill-in-the-blank procedure might help him to answer.\n\n“a saaaad nityes”\n\n“Your dream was about a sad night?” she asked.  “What made the night sad?”\n\n“hdeerd heard     hide   deaddddddddddddddddd,”  DJ typed.  He had a habit of depressing keys and watching the computer reproduce the letters endlessly.  But DJ was also becoming upset, and when he was upset his typing faltered more than usual.\n\n“What was dead?”\n\n“giiiiirl,” he said.\n\n“Did you know her?”\n\n“yes”\n\n“What was the girl’s name?”\n\n“eklki,” he typed.\n\n“Sister Ellie?”\n\n“yes”\n\n“In real life sister Ellie is OK.  She lives in the Northeast,” Emily explained.  “Would you like to   write    talk    see    her?” she asked.\n\n“se33e,” he answered, letting out a loud shriek and starting to cry.\n\n“Do you remember skating and swinging with her?” Emily possessed unfailing judgment, and she’d clearly decided this was the moment to pursue the past.\n\n“ues,” DJ replied.\n\n“Ellie is very nice.”\n\n“when you were giiomg giuither [going get her],” DJ typed, now sobbing.  So, he knew I was traveling to the Northeast and thought somehow I might return with his sister.\n\n“You miss Ellie.  She loves you very much.”\n\n“yesw.”\n\n“when you ftherrrrrrrrrrrrff,”\n\n“When you find her?” Emily clarified.\n\n“findhergoinggither,” DJ typed insistently.   If the house were a mine shaft, we were all falling through it—Emily, DJ, Rachel, Phil, and I.  As impressive as the demonstration of cognitive competence had been, it was DJ’s heart that moved us most, his commitment to his sister, confirming what we’d always known: he missed her terribly.\n\nJust before Christmas, DJ had produced his first story—his first sustained piece—about Frosty the Snowman and his pal Jimmy.  The story concluded with the following lines, and we thought of them again when DJ inquired about his sister.  If the story seems more composed than his customary communication, it’s because he worked on it endlessly.  Every element of it is his; Emily and I simply asked him if a given word or sentence was correct, and slowly but surely, he came up with this:\n\nThey were standing on the dock, standing and looking at the stars.  They turned and ran away.  They flew home.  They hugged, then waved goodbye.  They were sad.\nJimmy is dreaming about Frosty.  He is sad because Frosty i melting.  Jimmy is going to miss his friend Frosty.\n\nThe deep longing in these utterances and their obvious resonance with DJ’s life had stunned us.  I was particularly impressed by the syntax of the first line (a construction I’d been trying to teach my creative writing students).  It fixed the two characters on the dock in a posture of earnest contemplation, the way that an image in a poem might.  “What’s the meaning of it all?”  “Why is there loss?” the story inquired, half-expecting the stars to provide an answer.\n\n     Miss Louden conducted a creative writing workshop with her class, and one of the students responded to DJ’s story with a suggestion: in effect, that the problem of Frosty’s melting ought to be introduced earlier in the narrative.  DJ went bananas, screaming, hitting his head.  When Mrs. Lohman walked him out of the classroom and calmed him down, he typed on the computer, “dont want yelp [help] its my story.”  Even Mrs. Lohman, who had been struck, delighted in the pride DJ was showing in his work.  Emily joked that DJ took after his father.  While getting an MFA in poetry writing, I’d found receiving criticism similarly unbearable.\n\n     It had taken DJ forever to write the story.  The one-finger typing, the autistic fading in and out, the process of asking for clarifications and corrections, the multiple drafts—all of it made for very slow going.  Miss Louden and Mr. Abarr were terrific about granting extensions.  They were terrific in general, waiting for us at the door when we picked DJ up to tell us about his latest accomplishment.  They always had their lesson plans ready well in advance so that Emily could do the modifications.  Mr. Abarr worked with DJ sometimes one-on one, as did Miss Louden.  Miss Louden learned lots of useful sign language, incorporating it into the daily routine.  She had the class, for example, sign the “Pledge of Allegiance” each morning.  She also used the finger alphabet in spelling exercises.  Both frequently called on DJ in class.  For the first time in Iowa, he seemed like a fully active participant in his regular ed classes.', 'An Excerpt', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '376-revision', '', '', '2010-08-27 13:31:40', '2010-08-27 20:31:40', '', 376, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/376-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I worked on my dissertation, taught classes at UF, and looked after DJ; Emily continued to work at CARD and spent lots and lots of time at Liney.  During this year, DJ made significant communicative leaps.  His signing improved to the point that he could say, “I want to eat” or “I want to take a bath,” though it remained strictly utilitarian and very repetitive.  Issues with finger dexterity suggested that sophisticated signing might not be in DJ’s future.  While he recognized more and more signs, he couldn’t produce them himself, even after much practice.  We continued to cover our house—all of the objects in it—with sign diagrams, picture symbols, and words, especially words, immersing DJ in what experts call a “print-rich environment.”  We also pressed on with speech therapy and, of course, OT.\r\n\r\nIf the primary goal of kindergarten had been to acquaint DJ with the expectations, routines, and activities of a regular school, then the goal of first grade was to begin the long march to literacy.  Though Emily didn’t know whether he was a gestalt learner, she’d suspected he had great trouble deciphering spoken language and thus believed it pointless to teach phonics.  Instead, she focused on sight recognition, utilizing his cultivated familiarity with puzzles and his desire to close the system (as with toileting) to build alphabet, number, and word awareness.  The reading program DJ worked on began by asking him simply to find a word printed on the left hand side of the page in a grouping of, first, two, then, three, then, four, then five words on the right side of the page.  The words would be accompanied by picture symbols or diagrams.  “Point to same,” we’d tell DJ in sign, and he’d take the word on the left, which had Velcro on its back, and attach it to the proper word on the right.  Before he’d actually attach the word, we’d make sure it was correct by asking him to point to his answer.  A proponent of “error-free learning,” Emily believed that it was important to keep him from memorizing the wrong answer and to relieve the pressure of being right (especially for a kid with fragile self esteem who hadn’t yet secured his place in a regular classroom).  The physical act of velcroing the word to its partner closed the system in a definitive manner. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, DJ was correct only about thirty percent of the time, and so we’d have to ask him to reconsider.  “Find same,” we’d say over and over, and he’d point to something else.  Endless (and I mean endless) repetition accustomed him to English letters and letter groupings.  Seeing the corresponding picture and sign helped to connect these graphic symbols to the things they represented.  When we began, we had no idea if this literacy strategy would work or how far it would take us; we just knew that what had been tried previously hadn’t worked.  Early in the first grade, the Resource Room teacher at Liney saw that DJ was having success in matching words, and fairly soon she became one of DJ’s most ardent advocates.  In fact, when Mrs. Bollinger left to take the administrative post in the district, she assumed the PBS and IEP leadership role, problem solving creatively and intelligently.\r\n\r\nGetting DJ to focus continued to be a problem, but we were making progress there as well.  Having read a number of autobiographical accounts of autism, Emily advanced the theory of sensory input difficulties as a major impediment, perhaps the major impediment, to learning.  Lack of input, too much input, a system of sensory processing wildly out of whack—these were the issues confronting kids with autism, kids who couldn’t seem to focus.  At times, the everyday world was like a siren blaring in their ears or a fireworks display before their eyes.  At other times, a void: a blank, operating room white, with the Autist like a patient on a table who doesn’t feel a thing—a patient in search of his body.  The challenge was to tame the distractions the rest of us knew how to tune out and/or to provide the missing sensation.  Somehow we convinced the folks at Liney that DJ needed regular sensory-input breaks: moon-shoes, a mini-trampoline, brushing, swinging, walking.  You can’t imagine the look on the new principal’s face when the Resource Room teacher suggested that the courtyard outside the first grade classroom might be a good place for DJ’s trampoline.  Envisioning a fourteen-foot trampoline that only DJ could use, the principal seemed shocked.  “No, a much smaller one--like they use for aerobics,” the Resource Room teacher said, appreciating the principal’s concern.  That almost no one scoffed at these unconventional pedagogical methods spoke to how invested the school had become in DJ’s success.\r\n\r\nOnce DJ had mastered the task of matching words, we moved on to fill-in-the-blank sentences.  Again, we employed pictures to help convey the meaning of a sentence, focusing on one part of speech, one part of the sentence, at a time.  Here, “error-free learning” was even more important, as DJ, at least initially, couldn’t pick the proper word from the assembled word bank.  For a good long while, we simply modeled the right choice, conceiving of the exercise as intensive spelling and vocabulary training.  After we pointed out the correct answer, we’d have him attach it with Velcro to the blank in the sentence.  Over and over, we repeated this process, hoping that meaning might stick and that eventually syntactical relationships might become evident.  While we saw signs of improvement, the going was very slow indeed—slow and erratic, with tiny bursts of insight and knowledge consolidation, followed by inexplicable setbacks.   \r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, where he spent one period per day, DJ moved through a series of stations.  One involved the hand-over-hand tracing of his name or the execution of alphabet pages where he had to cut out a letter and glue it on the page and then color all of the pictures of the objects that began with that letter.  One was a puzzle of some sort.  Another was a picture with the shape of the corresponding word carved out.  DJ had to spell the word by putting the correct plastic letter in the correct cut out letter space.  This he could do errorlessly on his own, and then a device called “Leapfrog” would say the word out loud.  A fourth involved one-on-one reading with the Resource Room teacher.  Though DJ didn’t experience any genuinely explosive eureka moments, we felt as if we were laying a foundation: tediously, meticulously.  Yes, his concrete was taking longer to set, but we looked forward to helping him frame the sturdiest of structures.  It seemed as if a house was coming, or at least we thought it was.  By the end of the year, Kathy noticed that DJ was focusing on learning tasks more easily, beginning to recognize new vocabulary/spelling words by the third or fourth time they had practiced them, and moving around the school and Resource Room more independently.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn many respects, second grade was a continuation of first.  We added more words to DJ’s word banks (thereby giving him more choices) and, eventually, more blanks to his sentences.  We encouraged him to point as much as possible, making sure to correct him before he closed the system.  Where second grade differed from first was in the introduction of hand-over-hand typing.  He’d use a labeler to do his work, a portable machine that printed out full sentences that could then be stuck to a piece of paper.  Emily figured that DJ would likely continue to have finger dexterity problems and thus she believed that typing—not writing—would constitute his primary means of communication.  She also thought typing would serve as yet another way to expose him to print.  The keyboard would stabilize the location of letters and standardize them as well.  From a practical standpoint, the machine was very convenient—much, much better than the Velcro system, as the worksheets that comprised so much of elementary school life no longer required the same tedious preparation. \r\n\r\nIt’s important to underscore that at no time did we think we were practicing facilitated communication, that controversial communication technique from the 1990s in which someone supports the hand, wrist, or arm of a non-speaking person with autism as he or she types.  We knew that we were doing the typing, just as we knew back when we commenced the fill-in-the-blank exercises that we were answering the questions.  We sought simply to model every aspect of the exercise through repetition and full immersion.  We’d seen progress with the fill-in-the-blanks and, so, hypothesized that we might one day see progress with the typing.  When we eventually did see significant progress, we still didn’t call it FC—not because we were afraid to stir up controversy but because our path to success had been so atypical, involving years of practice and explicit literacy instruction before we even expected the kind of results normally associated with FC.  If, as the religiously inclined might propose, the average FC triumph was like the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, then ours was like the resurrection of Lazarus on the fourth or, rather, four hundredth day.  It wasn’t really a resurrection at all but a slow coming forth to communicative life, as if the cave in which Lazarus resided were several miles long and it had taken him years to limp out.  And yet, in emphasizing the gradual achievement of literacy, I need to make room for some sort of notion of a sudden, inconceivable burst—both with respect to the pace of DJ’s subsequent communicative achievement and, even more important, to the concomitant psychological awakening.  Only after DJ had been walking amongst us for months and months did we begin to speak of facilitated communication.\r\n\r\nWith the typing, we continued to follow the principle of error-free learning.  We’d read the fill-in-the-blank sentences aloud to DJ along with the possible answers and ask him to choose.  We wanted to work on his oral comprehension while we worked on literacy.  If DJ was wrong, we’d point to the correct answer, type it with him and then have him place it on the page.  We’d star those questions he got correct on his own.  If DJ pointed at four incorrect answers in a row, we assumed the information was too difficult for him and reverted to the cuing protocol used in the first grade.  When DJ’s classmates began writing simple sentences and very simple stories, we’d do a version of the same with fill-in-the-blank sentences and word banks comprised of equally acceptable answers.  This gave DJ a chance not only to complete writing assignments on his own but also to make choices—even if the choices he made he didn’t always understand.\r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, the Edmark reading program focused on nouns: find the yellow car, the green car, the small car, the large car.  After stabilizing the noun, it then stabilized the adjective: find the red car, the red apple, the red house, etc.  Instead of worrying about the names of different parts of speech, we emphasized practical application.  We took advantage of DJ’s ability to “find same,” breaking the category of “same” into smaller units of similarity and difference.  After lots of practice, he could identify the verb in a grouping of, say, apple, go, and purple.  In the Resource Room we began to leave three and four blanks in sentences or, for shorter sentences, to require DJ to assemble the entire sentence himself.  He had some success with these tasks.  By the end of second grade, DJ was able to stay in class with few, if no, breaks, provided that he was actively engaged.  He was able to do the various exercises described, with the exception of the sentence assembly, with a seventy-five percent accuracy rate.  He was also able, with minimal cuing, to use his Cheaptalk device, which Emily would load with lots of answer banks, to participate in class.\r\n\r\nWhat did DJ’s progress amount to?  Where were we?  We hadn’t the foggiest idea.  Could DJ move from rigid drilling, as in a foreign language course, to something like fluency?  Would the rigid drilling help us achieve literacy but paradoxically reinforce his autism?  Anyone even remotely familiar with autism knows about the infamous tics and obsessions.  Maybe DJ would perseverate on Edmark exercises, insisting on finding “the red car, the red apple, the red house,” over and over.  How to get him to the point of meaningfully expressive communication?  How to get him to talk about his life and the feelings we knew he had?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nBy April, Ms. Leathers, the Resource Room teacher, and Mrs. Lohman reported that DJ seemed to be moving their hands when typing.  He’d point independently to a word in his word bank and then initiate the typing procedure.  They felt him guiding their hands to the appropriate keys.  Suddenly, he was able to read a story and complete six to eight worksheets on it.  The questions asked DJ to pick out relevant information: the color of the car, for example, or location of the hot air balloon.  For the first time, DJ was answering “wh” questions with complete accuracy.  Because we saw DJ first pointing to the correct answer in his word bank, we didn’t doubt for a second that he was guiding Ms. Leathers’ or Mrs. Lohman’s hands when typing, but we didn’t make a big deal of it.  We focused on the cognitive accomplishment, and, familiar with his finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination problems, simply assumed that DJ needed this kind of physical help. \r\n\r\nAgain, we didn’t call this help facilitated communication, neither privately with each other nor publicly at school or in the community, though that’s what it was.  It didn’t occur to us to ask DJ questions unrelated to the worksheets—about what he wanted to eat, for instance, or what he was thinking.  I can’t entirely explain why, especially since I’d made such a fuss at his first IEP about including the goal of asking questions about his life.  We were locked into our routine of using sign and pictures to determine DJ’s needs and using the labeler to work on his literacy skills.  Perhaps we’d grown too accustomed to the absence of more sophisticated expressive communication from DJ, underestimating what might have been possible right—or should I say, write—then.  We were still relying on fill-in-the-blanks, however, and we honestly didn’t think he could compose an entire sentence on his own.  Still, we could have set up a worksheet that said: I feel a) sad, b) happy, or c) mad, and the fact that we didn’t bothers me to this day.  His most passionate advocates were probably holding him back.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, we noticed that DJ was showing more interest in his regular ed math teacher’s instruction than in the basic addition/subtraction money worksheets we were having him do with his aide.  He literally seemed to crane his neck to see what was being written on the blackboard instead of concentrating on what was immediately in front of him.  Early on, we’d decided to focus exclusively on literacy and had only just begun to give him math materials.  Here, too, he shot forward—like some sort of spaceship assuming warp speed.  He’d clearly apprehended the concept of place value on his own, for he started solving more complicated problems, embarking, it seemed, on a daring space walk in the thin universe of numbers.  At the I.E.P in May, Ms. Leathers and Mrs. Lohman reported DJ’s progress and asked sheepishly if we’d ever consider just trying him out in the regular math curriculum.  For the first time, school personnel were setting the bar higher for DJ than we had.  It was quite a moment.  We found it ironic that the subject we’d entirely neglected might turn out to be DJ’s strongest.  His teachers for the following year, Mr. Abarr and Ms. Louden, were present at the meeting.  Though apprehensive about the experience that lay ahead, they were open to it, and they asked what they could do to help.  “Have your lesson plans ready in advance and expect DJ to actively participate in your classes,” Emily told them.\r\n\r\nWe spent the summer in Hilton Head at Em’s parents, where Emily continued to work with DJ on his alternative reading program, which she’d borrowed from the school.  DJ looked forward to his daily reading lessons, completing five to six worksheets a day and taking only two days to complete each story.  On a short trip back to Florida, we had lunch with our friends the Rifkins, who have a son with autism.  Just home from a weeklong intensive seminar on using technology to access literacy for kids with autism, Margo inspired us to do more with computers.  We planned to apply for a state-funded Gemini: a high-powered Mac with touch-screen and voice capabilities that cost about seven thousand dollars.  DJ needed to be able to “speak” more than the pre-recorded messages on his Cheaptalk would allow.\r\n\r\nThe week before school began, he experienced his first expressive breakthrough.  Up until this point, all of his worksheets involved either fill-in-the-blank comprehension tasks or sequencing tasks, not open-ended questions.  Emily and DJ had been reading the program’s version of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” and they had arrived at the conclusion of the story where Jack and his mother sit enjoying their triumph.  The last question on the last page surprised—and worried—Emily.  Instead of asking for factual information from the story, it asked the student to imagine what the Mom might be thinking.  At this point, DJ was still conveying his answers by pointing to words in word banks and adhering them to the page in the appropriate place.  How could he possibly answer this question? Emily thought.  She considered either skipping it or offering three valid ideas of her own from which he might choose.  Before she could decide, DJ picked up his labeler and turned it on (something she’d never seen him do before).  He took Emily’s hand and purposefully guided it from letter to letter until he had typed out: “where a dad.”  The incorrect grammar, the obvious way in which this statement reflected his own life experience, and the fact that Emily had no idea what he was going to type (in the past, they’d simply typed his already identified answer) stopped her dead in her tracks.  With tears in her eyes, she called me into the room and narrated for me what had just happened.  I was dumbfounded.  “Where a Dad?”—an exceedingly relevant question from a boy whose family life had been so unstable.  “Wow, DJ!” I exclaimed, “wow!”\r\n\r\nA week later, after he’d correctly solved a math problem, the worksheet asked him to explain his answer.  To which DJ replied, once again picking up his labeler and taking hold of Emily’s hand, “becuse just.”  So, DJ understood colloquial English as well, except he’d transposed the two words, producing that brother-from-another-planet translation effect that seemed like poetry.  The fall was one long whirr of accomplishment.  “What is a subway?” “subway is underbus,” DJ answered, either coining his own clever definition or simply failing to hit the space bar on the labeler.  “What is a pyramid?”  “opyramid us [is] sand triwangle.”  This answer floored Emily and me—once, of course, we’d accustomed ourselves to the characteristic errors in his typing: in particular, hitting the key next to the one he wanted.  We’d encountered these errors before, but now we had no idea what he was going to say.  “A sand triangle” seemed as good a short definition of a pyramid as I’d ever come across; you could tell it was the product of a visual thinker—almost painterly its minimalist, compositional emphasis.  “What is a mummy?”  “kijng tut,” DJ answered.  “What is a capital?”  “big ciuty.”  “What is a festival?  “uit iws sa pwarty.”  “What are monuments?”  “detad people live there.” \r\n\r\nHow did DJ know the answers to these questions?  Had he been reading before we knew he was reading--not only reading but thinking, processing, refining?  His answers suggested something far different from rote memorization or rigid regurgitation: the expected mastery of someone autistic.  Hyperbole can’t do justice to our excitement, our awe, at DJ’s achievements.  Our friend Judy Barber, the district’s speech/language person, said in disbelief, “This isn’t supposed to be happening.  The kid isn’t falling farther and farther behind; he’s catching up!”  As excited as we were, we consciously decided not to bombard DJ with questions about his life.  Before, we’d failed to move quickly enough; now we wanted to focus on integrating the labeler into everyday routines, careful about overwhelming him emotionally.  But what was he thinking?  I had to resist handing over the stacks and stacks of pennies I’d saved for precisely this moment—a whole piggy bank’s worth to make up for lost time.  We’d let him choose when he wanted to weigh in on his past or present.  He seemed to need to get used to this new ability or, if not the ability itself, the experience of reciprocal exchange in a non-school or school-related setting.  He needed to get used to having unscripted conversations.  Though he appeared genuinely pleased by his accomplishments, he also appeared to be more nervous than usual, edgier, at times even frantic.\r\n\r\nBy mid-fall, DJ was doing regular fourth-grade math, marveling everyone.  On his first test he received a “B-,” but after that, nothing but “A”s.  Mr. Abarr had started DJ out on a calculator but very quickly realized that he was doing the problems in his head.  With a 100s chart he could simply point to the answer and then with assistance write it and place it on the page.  One day in language arts, at the beginning of a unit on the Titanic disaster, when Miss Louden was trying to determine the kids’ familiarity with the event, DJ typed out, “There were rich people on the boat.  There were poor people down below.  I was poor person once.”  (It’s one of the few things DJ’s typed that I don’t have, so I can’t reproduce his characteristic typos, but I saw the page and memorized the remark.)  Everyone was stunned by what DJ knew of the less romanticized version of the incident and how he’d identified with the ship’s least fortunate travelers.  When Miss. Louden asked the class what it would have been like to be a passenger on the Titanic, DJ typed, “Scared to die.” \r\n\r\nHow to account for a neurologically disabled fourth-grader with both class and existential consciousness?  How did DJ know these things?  How, with almost no training in math, could he do complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems in his head?  How?  How?  How?  How?  Later, when I’d start investigating this phenomenon, I’d discover that nobody really had an adequate theory beyond a notion of the child with autism somehow storing information (without exactly understanding it) and accessing it once he or she had come to communicative life.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThe day after Christmas, as I was preparing to leave for the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, Emily had a conversation with DJ on his laptop.  DJ had awakened at three in the morning and hadn’t been able to fall back to sleep.  Em’s folks, who had purchased the laptop for DJ when it became clear that the more powerful Mac would take months to get and that he really needed something more portable anyway, were sitting in the living room watching the conversation unfold.  Throughout the fall, they’d heard about DJ’s amazing progress but now they were getting to see it for themselves.\r\n\r\n“What woke you up this morning?” Emily asked.\r\n\r\n“adr  A dreammmmmm,” DJ typed.\r\n\r\n“About what?  Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“i dont know,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“My dream was about __________.”  Emily hoped that the fill-in-the-blank procedure might help him to answer.\r\n\r\n“a saaaad nityes”\r\n\r\n“Your dream was about a sad night?” she asked.  “What made the night sad?”\r\n\r\n“hdeerd heard     hide   deaddddddddddddddddd,”  DJ typed.  He had a habit of depressing keys and watching the computer reproduce the letters endlessly.  But DJ was also becoming upset, and when he was upset his typing faltered more than usual.\r\n\r\n“What was dead?”\r\n\r\n“giiiiirl,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Did you know her?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“What was the girl’s name?”\r\n\r\n“eklki,” he typed.\r\n\r\n“Sister Ellie?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“In real life sister Ellie is OK.  She lives in the Northeast,” Emily explained.  “Would you like to   write    talk    see    her?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“se33e,” he answered, letting out a loud shriek and starting to cry.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember skating and swinging with her?” Emily possessed unfailing judgment, and she’d clearly decided this was the moment to pursue the past.\r\n\r\n“ues,” DJ replied.\r\n\r\n“Ellie is very nice.”\r\n\r\n“when you were giiomg giuither [going get her],” DJ typed, now sobbing.  So, he knew I was traveling to the Northeast and thought somehow I might return with his sister.\r\n\r\n“You miss Ellie.  She loves you very much.”\r\n\r\n“yesw.”\r\n\r\n“when you ftherrrrrrrrrrrrff,”\r\n\r\n“When you find her?” Emily clarified.\r\n\r\n“findhergoinggither,” DJ typed insistently.   If the house were a mine shaft, we were all falling through it—Emily, DJ, Rachel, Phil, and I.  As impressive as the demonstration of cognitive competence had been, it was DJ’s heart that moved us most, his commitment to his sister, confirming what we’d always known: he missed her terribly.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas, DJ had produced his first story—his first sustained piece—about Frosty the Snowman and his pal Jimmy.  The story concluded with the following lines, and we thought of them again when DJ inquired about his sister.  If the story seems more composed than his customary communication, it’s because he worked on it endlessly.  Every element of it is his; Emily and I simply asked him if a given word or sentence was correct, and slowly but surely, he came up with this:\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the dock, standing and looking at the stars.  They turned and ran away.  They flew home.  They hugged, then waved goodbye.  They were sad.\r\nJimmy is dreaming about Frosty.  He is sad because Frosty i melting.  Jimmy is going to miss his friend Frosty.\r\n\r\nThe deep longing in these utterances and their obvious resonance with DJ’s life had stunned us.  I was particularly impressed by the syntax of the first line (a construction I’d been trying to teach my creative writing students).  It fixed the two characters on the dock in a posture of earnest contemplation, the way that an image in a poem might.  “What’s the meaning of it all?”  “Why is there loss?” the story inquired, half-expecting the stars to provide an answer.\r\n\r\n     Miss Louden conducted a creative writing workshop with her class, and one of the students responded to DJ’s story with a suggestion: in effect, that the problem of Frosty’s melting ought to be introduced earlier in the narrative.  DJ went bananas, screaming, hitting his head.  When Mrs. Lohman walked him out of the classroom and calmed him down, he typed on the computer, “dont want yelp [help] its my story.”  Even Mrs. Lohman, who had been struck, delighted in the pride DJ was showing in his work.  Emily joked that DJ took after his father.  While getting an MFA in poetry writing, I’d found receiving criticism similarly unbearable.\r\n\r\n     It had taken DJ forever to write the story.  The one-finger typing, the autistic fading in and out, the process of asking for clarifications and corrections, the multiple drafts—all of it made for very slow going.  Miss Louden and Mr. Abarr were terrific about granting extensions.  They were terrific in general, waiting for us at the door when we picked DJ up to tell us about his latest accomplishment.  They always had their lesson plans ready well in advance so that Emily could do the modifications.  Mr. Abarr worked with DJ sometimes one-on one, as did Miss Louden.  Miss Louden learned lots of useful sign language, incorporating it into the daily routine.  She had the class, for example, sign the “Pledge of Allegiance” each morning.  She also used the finger alphabet in spelling exercises.  Both frequently called on DJ in class.  For the first time in Iowa, he seemed like a fully active participant in his regular ed classes.', 'An Excerpt', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '376-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-27 13:32:12', '2010-08-27 20:32:12', '', 376, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/376-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I worked on my dissertation, taught classes at UF, and looked after DJ; Emily continued to work at CARD and spent lots and lots of time at Liney.  During this year, DJ made significant communicative leaps.  His signing improved to the point that he could say, “I want to eat” or “I want to take a bath,” though it remained strictly utilitarian and very repetitive.  Issues with finger dexterity suggested that sophisticated signing might not be in DJ’s future.  While he recognized more and more signs, he couldn’t produce them himself, even after much practice.  We continued to cover our house—all of the objects in it—with sign diagrams, picture symbols, and words, especially words, immersing DJ in what experts call a “print-rich environment.”  We also pressed on with speech therapy and, of course, OT.\r\n\r\nIf the primary goal of kindergarten had been to acquaint DJ with the expectations, routines, and activities of a regular school, then the goal of first grade was to begin the long march to literacy.  Though Emily didn’t know whether he was a gestalt learner, she’d suspected he had great trouble deciphering spoken language and thus believed it pointless to teach phonics.  Instead, she focused on sight recognition, utilizing his cultivated familiarity with puzzles and his desire to close the system (as with toileting) to build alphabet, number, and word awareness.  The reading program DJ worked on began by asking him simply to find a word printed on the left hand side of the page in a grouping of, first, two, then, three, then, four, then five words on the right side of the page.  The words would be accompanied by picture symbols or diagrams.  “Point to same,” we’d tell DJ in sign, and he’d take the word on the left, which had Velcro on its back, and attach it to the proper word on the right.  Before he’d actually attach the word, we’d make sure it was correct by asking him to point to his answer.  A proponent of “error-free learning,” Emily believed that it was important to keep him from memorizing the wrong answer and to relieve the pressure of being right (especially for a kid with fragile self esteem who hadn’t yet secured his place in a regular classroom).  The physical act of velcroing the word to its partner closed the system in a definitive manner. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, DJ was correct only about thirty percent of the time, and so we’d have to ask him to reconsider.  “Find same,” we’d say over and over, and he’d point to something else.  Endless (and I mean endless) repetition accustomed him to English letters and letter groupings.  Seeing the corresponding picture and sign helped to connect these graphic symbols to the things they represented.  When we began, we had no idea if this literacy strategy would work or how far it would take us; we just knew that what had been tried previously hadn’t worked.  Early in the first grade, the Resource Room teacher at Liney saw that DJ was having success in matching words, and fairly soon she became one of DJ’s most ardent advocates.  In fact, when Mrs. Bollinger left to take the administrative post in the district, she assumed the PBS and IEP leadership role, problem solving creatively and intelligently.\r\n\r\nGetting DJ to focus continued to be a problem, but we were making progress there as well.  Having read a number of autobiographical accounts of autism, Emily advanced the theory of sensory input difficulties as a major impediment, perhaps the major impediment, to learning.  Lack of input, too much input, a system of sensory processing wildly out of whack—these were the issues confronting kids with autism, kids who couldn’t seem to focus.  At times, the everyday world was like a siren blaring in their ears or a fireworks display before their eyes.  At other times, a void: a blank, operating room white, with the Autist like a patient on a table who doesn’t feel a thing—a patient in search of his body.  The challenge was to tame the distractions the rest of us knew how to tune out and/or to provide the missing sensation.  Somehow we convinced the folks at Liney that DJ needed regular sensory-input breaks: moon-shoes, a mini-trampoline, brushing, swinging, walking.  You can’t imagine the look on the new principal’s face when the Resource Room teacher suggested that the courtyard outside the first grade classroom might be a good place for DJ’s trampoline.  Envisioning a fourteen-foot trampoline that only DJ could use, the principal seemed shocked.  “No, a much smaller one--like they use for aerobics,” the Resource Room teacher said, appreciating the principal’s concern.  That almost no one scoffed at these unconventional pedagogical methods spoke to how invested the school had become in DJ’s success.\r\n\r\nOnce DJ had mastered the task of matching words, we moved on to fill-in-the-blank sentences.  Again, we employed pictures to help convey the meaning of a sentence, focusing on one part of speech, one part of the sentence, at a time.  Here, “error-free learning” was even more important, as DJ, at least initially, couldn’t pick the proper word from the assembled word bank.  For a good long while, we simply modeled the right choice, conceiving of the exercise as intensive spelling and vocabulary training.  After we pointed out the correct answer, we’d have him attach it with Velcro to the blank in the sentence.  Over and over, we repeated this process, hoping that meaning might stick and that eventually syntactical relationships might become evident.  While we saw signs of improvement, the going was very slow indeed—slow and erratic, with tiny bursts of insight and knowledge consolidation, followed by inexplicable setbacks.   \r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, where he spent one period per day, DJ moved through a series of stations.  One involved the hand-over-hand tracing of his name or the execution of alphabet pages where he had to cut out a letter and glue it on the page and then color all of the pictures of the objects that began with that letter.  One was a puzzle of some sort.  Another was a picture with the shape of the corresponding word carved out.  DJ had to spell the word by putting the correct plastic letter in the correct cut out letter space.  This he could do errorlessly on his own, and then a device called “Leapfrog” would say the word out loud.  A fourth involved one-on-one reading with the Resource Room teacher.  Though DJ didn’t experience any genuinely explosive eureka moments, we felt as if we were laying a foundation: tediously, meticulously.  Yes, his concrete was taking longer to set, but we looked forward to helping him frame the sturdiest of structures.  It seemed as if a house was coming, or at least we thought it was.  By the end of the year, Kathy noticed that DJ was focusing on learning tasks more easily, beginning to recognize new vocabulary/spelling words by the third or fourth time they had practiced them, and moving around the school and Resource Room more independently.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn many respects, second grade was a continuation of first.  We added more words to DJ’s word banks (thereby giving him more choices) and, eventually, more blanks to his sentences.  We encouraged him to point as much as possible, making sure to correct him before he closed the system.  Where second grade differed from first was in the introduction of hand-over-hand typing.  He’d use a labeler to do his work, a portable machine that printed out full sentences that could then be stuck to a piece of paper.  Emily figured that DJ would likely continue to have finger dexterity problems and thus she believed that typing—not writing—would constitute his primary means of communication.  She also thought typing would serve as yet another way to expose him to print.  The keyboard would stabilize the location of letters and standardize them as well.  From a practical standpoint, the machine was very convenient—much, much better than the Velcro system, as the worksheets that comprised so much of elementary school life no longer required the same tedious preparation. \r\n\r\nIt’s important to underscore that at no time did we think we were practicing facilitated communication, that controversial communication technique from the 1990s in which someone supports the hand, wrist, or arm of a non-speaking person with autism as he or she types.  We knew that we were doing the typing, just as we knew back when we commenced the fill-in-the-blank exercises that we were answering the questions.  We sought simply to model every aspect of the exercise through repetition and full immersion.  We’d seen progress with the fill-in-the-blanks and, so, hypothesized that we might one day see progress with the typing.  When we eventually did see significant progress, we still didn’t call it FC—not because we were afraid to stir up controversy but because our path to success had been so atypical, involving years of practice and explicit literacy instruction before we even expected the kind of results normally associated with FC.  If, as the religiously inclined might propose, the average FC triumph was like the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, then ours was like the resurrection of Lazarus on the fourth or, rather, four hundredth day.  It wasn’t really a resurrection at all but a slow coming forth to communicative life, as if the cave in which Lazarus resided were several miles long and it had taken him years to limp out.  And yet, in emphasizing the gradual achievement of literacy, I need to make room for some sort of notion of a sudden, inconceivable burst—both with respect to the pace of DJ’s subsequent communicative achievement and, even more important, to the concomitant psychological awakening.  Only after DJ had been walking amongst us for months and months did we begin to speak of facilitated communication.\r\n\r\nWith the typing, we continued to follow the principle of error-free learning.  We’d read the fill-in-the-blank sentences aloud to DJ along with the possible answers and ask him to choose.  We wanted to work on his oral comprehension while we worked on literacy.  If DJ was wrong, we’d point to the correct answer, type it with him and then have him place it on the page.  We’d star those questions he got correct on his own.  If DJ pointed at four incorrect answers in a row, we assumed the information was too difficult for him and reverted to the cuing protocol used in the first grade.  When DJ’s classmates began writing simple sentences and very simple stories, we’d do a version of the same with fill-in-the-blank sentences and word banks comprised of equally acceptable answers.  This gave DJ a chance not only to complete writing assignments on his own but also to make choices—even if the choices he made he didn’t always understand.\r\n\r\nIn the Resource Room, the Edmark reading program focused on nouns: find the yellow car, the green car, the small car, the large car.  After stabilizing the noun, it then stabilized the adjective: find the red car, the red apple, the red house, etc.  Instead of worrying about the names of different parts of speech, we emphasized practical application.  We took advantage of DJ’s ability to “find same,” breaking the category of “same” into smaller units of similarity and difference.  After lots of practice, he could identify the verb in a grouping of, say, apple, go, and purple.  In the Resource Room we began to leave three and four blanks in sentences or, for shorter sentences, to require DJ to assemble the entire sentence himself.  He had some success with these tasks.  By the end of second grade, DJ was able to stay in class with few, if no, breaks, provided that he was actively engaged.  He was able to do the various exercises described, with the exception of the sentence assembly, with a seventy-five percent accuracy rate.  He was also able, with minimal cuing, to use his Cheaptalk device, which Emily would load with lots of answer banks, to participate in class.\r\n\r\nWhat did DJ’s progress amount to?  Where were we?  We hadn’t the foggiest idea.  Could DJ move from rigid drilling, as in a foreign language course, to something like fluency?  Would the rigid drilling help us achieve literacy but paradoxically reinforce his autism?  Anyone even remotely familiar with autism knows about the infamous tics and obsessions.  Maybe DJ would perseverate on Edmark exercises, insisting on finding “the red car, the red apple, the red house,” over and over.  How to get him to the point of meaningfully expressive communication?  How to get him to talk about his life and the feelings we knew he had?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nBy April, Ms. Leathers, the Resource Room teacher, and Mrs. Lohman reported that DJ seemed to be moving their hands when typing.  He’d point independently to a word in his word bank and then initiate the typing procedure.  They felt him guiding their hands to the appropriate keys.  Suddenly, he was able to read a story and complete six to eight worksheets on it.  The questions asked DJ to pick out relevant information: the color of the car, for example, or location of the hot air balloon.  For the first time, DJ was answering “wh” questions with complete accuracy.  Because we saw DJ first pointing to the correct answer in his word bank, we didn’t doubt for a second that he was guiding Ms. Leathers’ or Mrs. Lohman’s hands when typing, but we didn’t make a big deal of it.  We focused on the cognitive accomplishment, and, familiar with his finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination problems, simply assumed that DJ needed this kind of physical help. \r\n\r\nAgain, we didn’t call this help facilitated communication, neither privately with each other nor publicly at school or in the community, though that’s what it was.  It didn’t occur to us to ask DJ questions unrelated to the worksheets—about what he wanted to eat, for instance, or what he was thinking.  I can’t entirely explain why, especially since I’d made such a fuss at his first IEP about including the goal of asking questions about his life.  We were locked into our routine of using sign and pictures to determine DJ’s needs and using the labeler to work on his literacy skills.  Perhaps we’d grown too accustomed to the absence of more sophisticated expressive communication from DJ, underestimating what might have been possible right—or should I say, write—then.  We were still relying on fill-in-the-blanks, however, and we honestly didn’t think he could compose an entire sentence on his own.  Still, we could have set up a worksheet that said: I feel a) sad, b) happy, or c) mad, and the fact that we didn’t bothers me to this day.  His most passionate advocates were probably holding him back.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, we noticed that DJ was showing more interest in his regular ed math teacher’s instruction than in the basic addition/subtraction money worksheets we were having him do with his aide.  He literally seemed to crane his neck to see what was being written on the blackboard instead of concentrating on what was immediately in front of him.  Early on, we’d decided to focus exclusively on literacy and had only just begun to give him math materials.  Here, too, he shot forward—like some sort of spaceship assuming warp speed.  He’d clearly apprehended the concept of place value on his own, for he started solving more complicated problems, embarking, it seemed, on a daring space walk in the thin universe of numbers.  At the I.E.P in May, Ms. Leathers and Mrs. Lohman reported DJ’s progress and asked sheepishly if we’d ever consider just trying him out in the regular math curriculum.  For the first time, school personnel were setting the bar higher for DJ than we had.  It was quite a moment.  We found it ironic that the subject we’d entirely neglected might turn out to be DJ’s strongest.  His teachers for the following year, Mr. Abarr and Ms. Louden, were present at the meeting.  Though apprehensive about the experience that lay ahead, they were open to it, and they asked what they could do to help.  “Have your lesson plans ready in advance and expect DJ to actively participate in your classes,” Emily told them.\r\n\r\nWe spent the summer in Hilton Head at Em’s parents, where Emily continued to work with DJ on his alternative reading program, which she’d borrowed from the school.  DJ looked forward to his daily reading lessons, completing five to six worksheets a day and taking only two days to complete each story.  On a short trip back to Florida, we had lunch with our friends the Rifkins, who have a son with autism.  Just home from a weeklong intensive seminar on using technology to access literacy for kids with autism, Margo inspired us to do more with computers.  We planned to apply for a state-funded Gemini: a high-powered Mac with touch-screen and voice capabilities that cost about seven thousand dollars.  DJ needed to be able to “speak” more than the pre-recorded messages on his Cheaptalk would allow.\r\n\r\nThe week before school began, he experienced his first expressive breakthrough.  Up until this point, all of his worksheets involved either fill-in-the-blank comprehension tasks or sequencing tasks, not open-ended questions.  Emily and DJ had been reading the program’s version of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” and they had arrived at the conclusion of the story where Jack and his mother sit enjoying their triumph.  The last question on the last page surprised—and worried—Emily.  Instead of asking for factual information from the story, it asked the student to imagine what the Mom might be thinking.  At this point, DJ was still conveying his answers by pointing to words in word banks and adhering them to the page in the appropriate place.  How could he possibly answer this question? Emily thought.  She considered either skipping it or offering three valid ideas of her own from which he might choose.  Before she could decide, DJ picked up his labeler and turned it on (something she’d never seen him do before).  He took Emily’s hand and purposefully guided it from letter to letter until he had typed out: “where a dad.”  The incorrect grammar, the obvious way in which this statement reflected his own life experience, and the fact that Emily had no idea what he was going to type (in the past, they’d simply typed his already identified answer) stopped her dead in her tracks.  With tears in her eyes, she called me into the room and narrated for me what had just happened.  I was dumbfounded.  “Where a Dad?”—an exceedingly relevant question from a boy whose family life had been so unstable.  “Wow, DJ!” I exclaimed, “wow!”\r\n\r\nA week later, after he’d correctly solved a math problem, the worksheet asked him to explain his answer.  To which DJ replied, once again picking up his labeler and taking hold of Emily’s hand, “becuse just.”  So, DJ understood colloquial English as well, except he’d transposed the two words, producing that brother-from-another-planet translation effect that seemed like poetry.  The fall was one long whirr of accomplishment.  “What is a subway?” “subway is underbus,” DJ answered, either coining his own clever definition or simply failing to hit the space bar on the labeler.  “What is a pyramid?”  “opyramid us [is] sand triwangle.”  This answer floored Emily and me—once, of course, we’d accustomed ourselves to the characteristic errors in his typing: in particular, hitting the key next to the one he wanted.  We’d encountered these errors before, but now we had no idea what he was going to say.  “A sand triangle” seemed as good a short definition of a pyramid as I’d ever come across; you could tell it was the product of a visual thinker—almost painterly its minimalist, compositional emphasis.  “What is a mummy?”  “kijng tut,” DJ answered.  “What is a capital?”  “big ciuty.”  “What is a festival?  “uit iws sa pwarty.”  “What are monuments?”  “detad people live there.” \r\n\r\nHow did DJ know the answers to these questions?  Had he been reading before we knew he was reading--not only reading but thinking, processing, refining?  His answers suggested something far different from rote memorization or rigid regurgitation: the expected mastery of someone autistic.  Hyperbole can’t do justice to our excitement, our awe, at DJ’s achievements.  Our friend Judy Barber, the district’s speech/language person, said in disbelief, “This isn’t supposed to be happening.  The kid isn’t falling farther and farther behind; he’s catching up!”  As excited as we were, we consciously decided not to bombard DJ with questions about his life.  Before, we’d failed to move quickly enough; now we wanted to focus on integrating the labeler into everyday routines, careful about overwhelming him emotionally.  But what was he thinking?  I had to resist handing over the stacks and stacks of pennies I’d saved for precisely this moment—a whole piggy bank’s worth to make up for lost time.  We’d let him choose when he wanted to weigh in on his past or present.  He seemed to need to get used to this new ability or, if not the ability itself, the experience of reciprocal exchange in a non-school or school-related setting.  He needed to get used to having unscripted conversations.  Though he appeared genuinely pleased by his accomplishments, he also appeared to be more nervous than usual, edgier, at times even frantic.\r\n\r\nBy mid-fall, DJ was doing regular fourth-grade math, marveling everyone.  On his first test he received a “B-,” but after that, nothing but “A”s.  Mr. Abarr had started DJ out on a calculator but very quickly realized that he was doing the problems in his head.  With a 100s chart he could simply point to the answer and then with assistance write it and place it on the page.  One day in language arts, at the beginning of a unit on the Titanic disaster, when Miss Louden was trying to determine the kids’ familiarity with the event, DJ typed out, “There were rich people on the boat.  There were poor people down below.  I was poor person once.”  (It’s one of the few things DJ’s typed that I don’t have, so I can’t reproduce his characteristic typos, but I saw the page and memorized the remark.)  Everyone was stunned by what DJ knew of the less romanticized version of the incident and how he’d identified with the ship’s least fortunate travelers.  When Miss. Louden asked the class what it would have been like to be a passenger on the Titanic, DJ typed, “Scared to die.” \r\n\r\nHow to account for a neurologically disabled fourth-grader with both class and existential consciousness?  How did DJ know these things?  How, with almost no training in math, could he do complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems in his head?  How?  How?  How?  How?  Later, when I’d start investigating this phenomenon, I’d discover that nobody really had an adequate theory beyond a notion of the child with autism somehow storing information (without exactly understanding it) and accessing it once he or she had come to communicative life.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThe day after Christmas, as I was preparing to leave for the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, Emily had a conversation with DJ on his laptop.  DJ had awakened at three in the morning and hadn’t been able to fall back to sleep.  Em’s folks, who had purchased the laptop for DJ when it became clear that the more powerful Mac would take months to get and that he really needed something more portable anyway, were sitting in the living room watching the conversation unfold.  Throughout the fall, they’d heard about DJ’s amazing progress but now they were getting to see it for themselves.\r\n\r\n“What woke you up this morning?” Emily asked.\r\n\r\n“adr  A dreammmmmm,” DJ typed.\r\n\r\n“About what?  Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“i dont know,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“My dream was about __________.”  Emily hoped that the fill-in-the-blank procedure might help him to answer.\r\n\r\n“a saaaad nityes”\r\n\r\n“Your dream was about a sad night?” she asked.  “What made the night sad?”\r\n\r\n“hdeerd heard     hide   deaddddddddddddddddd,”  DJ typed.  He had a habit of depressing keys and watching the computer reproduce the letters endlessly.  But DJ was also becoming upset, and when he was upset his typing faltered more than usual.\r\n\r\n“What was dead?”\r\n\r\n“giiiiirl,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Did you know her?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“What was the girl’s name?”\r\n\r\n“eklki,” he typed.\r\n\r\n“Sister Ellie?”\r\n\r\n“yes”\r\n\r\n“In real life sister Ellie is OK.  She lives in the Northeast,” Emily explained.  “Would you like to   write    talk    see    her?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“se33e,” he answered, letting out a loud shriek and starting to cry.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember skating and swinging with her?” Emily possessed unfailing judgment, and she’d clearly decided this was the moment to pursue the past.\r\n\r\n“ues,” DJ replied.\r\n\r\n“Ellie is very nice.”\r\n\r\n“when you were giiomg giuither [going get her],” DJ typed, now sobbing.  So, he knew I was traveling to the Northeast and thought somehow I might return with his sister.\r\n\r\n“You miss Ellie.  She loves you very much.”\r\n\r\n“yesw.”\r\n\r\n“when you ftherrrrrrrrrrrrff,”\r\n\r\n“When you find her?” Emily clarified.\r\n\r\n“findhergoinggither,” DJ typed insistently.   If the house were a mine shaft, we were all falling through it—Emily, DJ, Rachel, Phil, and I.  As impressive as the demonstration of cognitive competence had been, it was DJ’s heart that moved us most, his commitment to his sister, confirming what we’d always known: he missed her terribly.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas, DJ had produced his first story—his first sustained piece—about Frosty the Snowman and his pal Jimmy.  The story concluded with the following lines, and we thought of them again when DJ inquired about his sister.  If the story seems more composed than his customary communication, it’s because he worked on it endlessly.  Every element of it is his; Emily and I simply asked him if a given word or sentence was correct, and slowly but surely, he came up with this:\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the dock, standing and looking at the stars.  They turned and ran away.  They flew home.  They hugged, then waved goodbye.  They were sad.\r\nJimmy is dreaming about Frosty.  He is sad because Frosty i melting.  Jimmy is going to miss his friend Frosty.\r\n\r\nThe deep longing in these utterances and their obvious resonance with DJ’s life had stunned us.  I was particularly impressed by the syntax of the first line (a construction I’d been trying to teach my creative writing students).  It fixed the two characters on the dock in a posture of earnest contemplation, the way that an image in a poem might.  “What’s the meaning of it all?”  “Why is there loss?” the story inquired, half-expecting the stars to provide an answer.\r\n\r\n     Miss Louden conducted a creative writing workshop with her class, and one of the students responded to DJ’s story with a suggestion: in effect, that the problem of Frosty’s melting ought to be introduced earlier in the narrative.  DJ went bananas, screaming, hitting his head.  When Mrs. Lohman walked him out of the classroom and calmed him down, he typed on the computer, “dont want yelp [help] its my story.”  Even Mrs. Lohman, who had been struck, delighted in the pride DJ was showing in his work.  Emily joked that DJ took after his father.  While getting an MFA in poetry writing, I’d found receiving criticism similarly unbearable.\r\n\r\n     It had taken DJ forever to write the story.  The one-finger typing, the autistic fading in and out, the process of asking for clarifications and corrections, the multiple drafts—all of it made for very slow going.  Miss Louden and Mr. Abarr were terrific about granting extensions.  They were terrific in general, waiting for us at the door when we picked DJ up to tell us about his latest accomplishment.  They always had their lesson plans ready well in advance so that Emily could do the modifications.  Mr. Abarr worked with DJ sometimes one-on one, as did Miss Louden.  Miss Louden learned lots of useful sign language, incorporating it into the daily routine.  She had the class, for example, sign the “Pledge of Allegiance” each morning.  She also used the finger alphabet in spelling exercises.  Both frequently called on DJ in class.  For the first time in Iowa, he seemed like a fully active participant in his regular ed classes.', 'Excerpt', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '376-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-27 13:32:50', '2010-08-27 20:32:50', '', 376, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/376-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

He writes:\r\n\r\nTo many experts, the non-speaking Autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.\r\n\r\nTo be autistic and to be non-verbal was once, Savarese suggests, to be a kind of human black hole, a bottomless, empty, mysterious nothingness that took in information and stimuli and never did anything it. And this is, I suspect and I know, how my son, Charlie, would have been regarded had he been born fifty years ago, forty, twenty; and this is how DJ, Savarese’s adopted autistic son, might still be regarded had he not been taught to type the words inside of him.\r\n\r\nSavarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> tells many stories: How DJ came into his parents-to-be’s lives in Florida; how DJ suffered in the “care” of a foster parent; how Savarese becomes a father; how 9-year-old DJ, after several years of hand-over-hand typing, emerges into “full-blown communication.” DJ is now a straight-A honor roll student in middle school in a town in south-central Iowa. And DJ wrote the final chapter (”It’s My Story”) of Savarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em>. Just because a child—an autistic child—cannot speak, cannot express himself orally—-does not mean that he cannot speak, as this book by Savarese and by DJ shows. The black hole is not so bleak, not so silent, after all. \r\n\r\nSavarese, who teaches American literature and creative writing at Grinnell College, begins Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption by describing the new version of the black hole: Rather than swallowing up all particles, all information, forever, black holes are now said to allow information to escape. Savarese quotes no less an expert on these matters than physicist Stephen Hawking—-indeed, he refers to an incident in July of 2004, in which Hawking officially conceded a bet to his Cal-Tech colleague, John Preskill. "As the headline from the Technology and Science page of the MSNBC website put it, ''Hawking changes his mind on black holes: Galactic traps may actually allow information to escape.'' At the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, Ireland, Hawking presented Preskill with a book: <em>Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia</em>. In doing so, the world’s most famous physicist mocked his own theory with an object from which, in the words of one reporter, “information is easily retrieved.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> is a gripping narrative of how DJ came into his and his wife Emily’s life, of how autism came into his life; of how a child who many “experts” had written off, has himself learned to write and can tell his own story.

We adopted her five years ago, and she came to us with special needs—ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and various other issues. My mantra—"she’s easy to love, but hard to raise"—is inadequate in describing either the intense love and joy or the chaos and exhaustion she’s brought to my life.\r\n\r\n<em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em>, by Ralph James Savarese (Other Press; $25.95), states—clearly, concisely, and with passion—why some people adopt.

DJ has autism. He doesn’t speak, and he experienced severe trauma before joining his family. Woven into the story of their adoption journey, the challenges and triumphs they’ve shared along the way, are Savarese’s treatises on the politics of differing abilities, foster care and adoption, and the meaning of family.\r\n\r\nIt’s an intellectually (morally, ideologically) challenging read. But to say it’s "worth the challenge" would imply that I had to slog through it. That’s not true—I could hardly put it down. DJ, who now practices "facilitated communication," using a computer, wrote the final chapter himself. "I resent these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone," he writes. It isn’t easy reading, DJ. It’s life-changing reading.\r\n\r\nI e-mailed Savarese, hoping for a quote I could include in my review. Reading it gave me shivers. It will tell you, more clearly than I ever could, why you should read the book.\r\n\r\nIn the author’s words:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I hate the fetish of blood relations. Not only does it make adopted children and families feel like second-class citizens, but it perniciously tells us that our ethical obligations extend no further than our natural (as opposed to artificial) ties. So screw the homeless man on the street or the poor family on the other side of town. So long as I''m good to my mother, well, then, I''m a good person. Baloney! We need to open our eyes to the predicaments of those less fortunate; we need to look beyond the walls of the gated community that is often the blood family. More creative family making might actually help us to realize the sentimental trope of the “human family.”\r\n\r\nFor my wife and me, adoption was a FIRST-resort adventure in responding to the desperate plight of a badly abused, wordless little boy. This boy has given us MORE than we have given him. Has it been exhausting? You bet; the most exhausting and challenging and anxiety-producing thing I have ever done. Ever. But also the most rewarding.\r\n\r\nWhy are we on this planet? I believe to grow in our capacity to care and attend to human suffering. By stretching ourselves, sometimes beyond measure, we find a joy that approximates wisdom. My wife and I are NOT saints and don''t appreciate being compared to such beings. Our relationship has suffered. We don''t have time for the many things we used to do. But whose relationship hasn''t suffered with the arrival of kids, whether adopted or not?

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\r\n\r\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\r\n\r\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\r\n\r\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\r\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\r\n\r\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently. Since the eighteenth century, the criteria for human species membership have been determined in great part by mental capacity and especially linguistic capability. Whether those in whom linguistic capability is compromised will be accorded a full set of human rights surfaces as the foremost question whenever non-verbal cognitive impairment comes under scrutiny. Indirectly addressing the issue is Gayatri Spivak''s 1988 essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in which she investigates whether the historically marginalized, colonized people truly are empowered to speak. For Spivak, the subaltern must be able to voice challenges to mistaken assumptions. Especially in the last thirty years, people with physical disabilities at least have spoken up for themselves through disability autobiography. G. Thomas Couser describes this genre as "an anti-colonial phenomenon, a form of autoethnography, as Mary Louise Pratt has defined it: ''instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in way that engage with [read: contest] the colonizer''s own terms.''" If people with physical disabilities can represent themselves and ''talk back'' to the hegemonic ablist culture through autobiography, how is a non-verbal person with a mental disability to do the same? In the grown-up-driven genre of the parental memoir, the adult speaks for the child. Consequently, with regard to these memoirs, a central concern for a reader coming from a disability rights perspective will be the degree of contact afforded between reader and child by the mediating parent-author.\r\n\r\nSavarese follows Oe''s lead by opening a space for DJ to present himself to the reader: the young man contributes the sixteenth and final chapter entitled "It''s My Story!" The memoir''s first fifteen chapters really serve as prologue, explaining how DJ''s chapter came to be written. It is from this section in fact that the title Reasonable People derives; DJ writes, "I''m reasonable. Polite people make me feel comfortable. Which by the way isn''t very often. Reasonable people promote very very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me." Of the way he should be treated, he states, "People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind." Of the self-esteem beginning to shape up within him, he proclaims that "Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, kind, mighty, very smart self." In another passage he associates himself with the civil rights movement, and in another he contests the culturally fabricated assumptions of the neurotypical majority about people like him. At one point he even ''talks back'' to his former teachers in Florida, criticizing them sharply with regard to the education he received: "[Y]ears of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start could have begun sooner."\r\n\r\nWhat G. Thomas Couser observes of such texts as the 1994 <em>Count Us In:Growing Up with Down Syndrome</em> by Jason Kingsley and Mitchell Levitz could be extended to DJ''s chapter: "the very existence of first-person narratives makes its own point: that people with condition ''X'' are capable of self-representation. The autobiographical act models the agency and self-determination that the disability rights movement has fought for." Like Spivak''s subaltern, the purportedly nonverbal person with an intellectual disability not only can but will speak. In at least four ways this book makes a significant contribution to the national conversation on autism and to Disability Studies. First, "It''s My Story!" can be excerpted and read as a freestanding essay, perhaps in some future anthology of writing by people with learning disabilities. But even if such an anthology never materializes, this powerful piece of first-person exposition should find its way onto the reading lists of university-level Education and Cultural Disability Studies courses. It may be appropriate high school reading as well. Second, the book in its entirety can educate parents, teachers, and psychologists, encouraging them to experiment with Emily and Ralph''s techniques that worked so well with DJ. Third, it will reawaken interest in FC, by means of which DJ has been empowered to contest his supposedly ''non-verbal'' status. And fourth, those who read it will be forced to think twice about the various conventional wisdoms associated with autism, to expand their thinking, and in the end, hopefully, to reconsider "what is possible."', 'Disability Studies Quarterly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '189-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-23 11:55:53', '2010-08-23 18:55:53', '', 189, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/189-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations. He is sensitive to how others speak to his son and how they generalize about his disability.\r\n\r\nSon DJ, 15, would be coming home shortly from his second day of the new school year. He has autism.\r\n\r\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the\r\nprofessionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and\r\npuzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and\r\nunpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began\r\ntalking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h4>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h4>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children\r\nwere taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on\r\nthe failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe\r\nautism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and\r\nyears of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to\r\nconverse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own\r\ncranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t\r\nwant to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few\r\nwill do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the\r\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and\r\ncompulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away.\r\nAfter several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the\r\nhospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy.\r\nAt the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h4>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa-\r\nHenderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now\r\nteaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the\r\ndiagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also\r\nremains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing.\r\nI asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a\r\nstraight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There\r\nare frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe\r\ninsecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at\r\nodds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which\r\ntalks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had\r\nbecome stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be\r\nreasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for\r\nreasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople.\r\ncom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown,\r\nsquealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been\r\nworking on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these\r\nvery hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his\r\nplace in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged\r\nhim to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York\r\nliterary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with\r\nautism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting\r\nhopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the\r\nanxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up\r\nbetter boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will\r\nhave to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get\r\nmad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re\r\nsmart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\r\ncan understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future.

Activist and writer Ralph James Savarese thought he and his wife, Emily, had done just that. For her it meant working with a Florida center for disabled and autistic children. For him it meant writing and teaching college students about responsibility and social obligation. But in the late ''90s they found themselves forgoing these larger causes for the smaller one staring them right in the face: an abused, autistic toddler named DJ.\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association describes autism as a disorder of impaired communication and social skills (including the delay or total lack of spoken language) and restricted or repetitive behavior such as flapping of the hands. But that view, argues Savarese in “Reasonable People: a Memoir of Autism and Adoption,” robs people with autism of their humanity and in return offers little hope. “To many experts, the non-speaking autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.” Are we giving up too early on those with classic autism, he asks? Or could it be that an autist’s inner world, dynamic and profoundly human, can be made accessible if society is willing to make a reasonable effort to help it bloom?\r\n\r\nThe couple is first acquainted with the blond, curly-haired DJ when he is 3 years old and foundering in foster care. Emily works with DJ, whom she meets at her center, even though he’s been written off as profoundly retarded. She also tries, and fails, to get DJ’s alcoholic mother back on her feet. When DJ is severely beaten at his foster home, a caseworker begs the Savareses to provide emergency shelter. What follows is both a real-life love story and an urgent manifesto for the rights of people with neurological differences. Savarese is honest about both his own fears and how DJ is capable of plunging even the most dedicated and high-minded adult into despair. But three years and countless bureaucratic hurdles later, the Savarese family finally extracts DJ from foster care and formally adopts him.\r\n\r\nTheir aims are lofty. First, DJ’s is an “open adoption,” meaning that visits from his older sister or other family members are encouraged. Second, Savarese and his wife are proponents of a controversial educational method called “inclusion.” With the help of on-site personal aides, they manage to include DJ in regular classrooms in Florida and then Iowa. They tirelessly urge others to open their hearts and minds to the “creative potential” of DJ’s disease, even though he might flap his arms, use his head as a battering ram and scream uncontrollably. Through the much-maligned keyboard technique of “facilitated communication,” they help DJ make his first forays into language. At first the parents do much of the typing themselves; within a few years they are offering DJ only minimal support at the wrist. He has much to share, including a heartbreaking, garbled tale of abandonment and sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a thorough chronicler of both DJ’s progress and the current thinking on autism. At times his writing can be overly academic, but not when it comes to detailing DJ’s life and the ease with which disabled children are often written off. In foster care DJ was denied glasses--the doctor thought he was too severely disabled for improved vision to make a difference. So he has difficulty with tasks requiring hand-eye coordination--he does puzzles entirely by touch--until his adoptive parents figured out the problem. At first the simplest word in sign language took months to perfect. Yet by the end of Savarese’s moving memoir, DJ is in sixth grade and getting all “A’s” at a regular school. “DJ’s autism remains--in all of its sometimes marvelous, sometimes aggravating, splendor,” writes Savarese. “He hasn’t been cured.”  Nor has he conquered many troubling habits, such as poking people in the eyes. But the sixth-grader writes the memoir’s last chapter himself, with only minimal assistance. There are typos and DJ’s language is often inscrutable. But his words are evidence of qualities once thought impossible for the boy: a sense of self and a concern for others. “They think well-respected, tested-as-normal kids are the OK-to-teach ones,” writes DJ. “They forget these lost kids. ”  Perhaps this book will help others remember they are more than worth the effort.', 'Newsweek', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-23 11:21:48', '2010-08-23 18:21:48', '', 185, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/185-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.\r\n\r\nEmily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.\r\n\r\nAs the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:\r\n\r\n“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”\r\n\r\nIt pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:\r\n\r\n“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,\r\n\r\n“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”\r\n\r\nAs DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”\r\n\r\nThere may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,\r\n\r\n‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”\r\n\r\nRalph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.\r\n\r\n“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”\r\n\r\nIn Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.\r\n\r\nFor all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:\r\n\r\n“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations. This is, however, a story about what life is all about: trial, error, perseverance, and faith in people. Faith in love.

The sub-title of the book is as important to culture as the title itself: “On the meaning of family and the politics of neurological difference”.  This timely book is about the Horatian life, “Life” written with a capital “L”.  Accordingly it is about family and the life of the mind; about poetry and the fierce resistance to stereotypes of people with autism.\r\n\r\nAssuredly one can think of dozens of additional sub-titles for the book: Living Outside their Boxes; Unraveling the Outworn Tapestry of Academic Autism; A Prayer Wheel by Two Poets; or The Road of Salt and Honey.   \r\n\r\nThis is a memoir about “hard traveling” as Woody Guthrie would say, and yet it is far more than a narrative of trouble and triumph.  The poet, Ralph James Savarese, skillfully tells the story of his adoptive son DJ’s former life of physical and intellectual abuse and in turn and almost seamlessly tells the story of how he and his wife Emily must grow both intellectually and emotionally and yes, politically, since DJ’s autism is the kind of disability our culture has misunderstood throughout history.   \r\n\r\nRalph James Savarese is a poet who teaches creative writing and literature at Grinnell College.  With the publication of Reasonable People he joins a group of poets who have written nonfiction accounts of disability that includes Lucy Grealy, Nancy Mairs, Mary Karr, Kenny Fries, Michael Berube, and Audre Lorde just to name a few.  Reasonable People is a landmark book, both in its poetic appreciation of what Carl Jung’s followers call “depth psychology” and for its tough minded counter-statement to a longstanding view that autistic people will, necessarily have limited epistemological options in life.  Such views are the product of neo-Victorian science and they depend on the inability of individuals to resist easy classifications.  Such resistance is, of course, the business of poetry, that “sweat of the heart” as the poet Marvin Bell would call it.\r\n\r\nThis is a book about “joint attention” as Emily, Ralph, and DJ learn to appreciate the complex interactions between the self and the other, between the moment and what lies just behind us or straight ahead.  The book is about the dark theater of autism and the academy.  It is about the flesh of belief.  Beyond this I will tell you nothing for I dislike book reviews that retell the story.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a book about poetry and parenting it is perhaps most of all DJ’s own book for it ends with his journal notes and poems.  He is now a young man who speaks for himself and who aims his own telescope at the full moon.  Again, and not wishing to give away too much, let me simply quote one of DJ’s own poems which appears near the end of the book.  It is as fine a definition of poetry and the life of the mind as I have ever seen:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>HOW BRAVE?\r\nHe was so brave that free people\r\nSaluted him every time he passed by.\r\nSo brave, if you didn''t really know him\r\nYou''d think he was a god.\r\nSo brave, the tests he took couldn''t\r\nScare him.\r\nAnd so brave, all the dreadful creatures\r\nDied.\r\nThat''s brave!</blockquote>', 'Planet of the Blind', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '181-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-23 11:01:25', '2010-08-23 18:01:25', '', 181, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/181-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

So, this issue’s focus on the corporeal (Special Double Issue: The Lyric Body) is of particular interest. Of the body, editors Stephen Kuusisto and Ralph James Savarese say they present “a form for engagement" that "is always political…and always lyrical, whether we see it that way or not.” If lyrical means poetically inspired, and political means engaged with the world, then I would say their choices for the issue are, indeed, lyrical and political. And they’re also quite wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe issue features many stars and familiar names (Adrienne Rich, Gregory Orr, Sam Hamill, Susanne Antonetta, Jennifer Finney Boylan, Ilya Kaminsky, Floyd Sloot, Mary Doty, Rafael Campo, among others) and many less familiar, though no less worthy of attention, writers (Ona Gritz, Susan Neeley, Barrie Jean Borich, Katie Ford, Jane Bernstein, among others). A number of these writers have written beautifully in other publications (including books) about related or similar matters as those in their work here (Skloot, Borich, Campo, Bernstein), but when it comes to the body, this repetition (or is it obsession?) makes a kind of lyrical and political sense. Indeed, we can never escape our embodiment.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t a poem, story, or essay I would not recommend. There are a few standouts, though: Rebecca Epstein’s “My Last-Ditch Attempt,” a manic little essay about mania; Katie Ford’s poem, “Remedies for Sorrow” (“The soldierly ready / of human sadness; it must, by nature hover”); Susanne Antonetta’s essay, “Dis,” about a struggle with lithium; an essay by Barrie Jean Borich, “APOCALYPSE, Darling.” Borich has an appealing voice and is smart storyteller. She favors family tales (her in-laws this time around), and she’s one of the few writers who make me question my firm belief that stories about one’s family don’t interest anyone except, well, one’s own family. And this poem, “The Iridescence of Life,” by Melanie Almeder, inspired by a photograph/collage of Binh Dahn, clearly both lyrical and political:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>O gray and lopsided moon, above your face, the wings,\r\nthis room – moon that shone on the gutted heaps\r\nof the Khmer Rouge’s labor – if there’s grace left –please,\r\nlet there be grace left – then let it utter its syllables here,\r\nand unhinge the dear wing of your face.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFinally, more overtly political in theme than many of the works in the issue, and less overtly lyrical in language, but sublimely lyrical in intention, is Amitava Kumar’s diary/essay, “Tortured Body" which are "entries from a teacher''s diary kept during Bush’s war on terror.” If every student had a teacher like Kumar there would certainly be considerably more lyricism and less terror.\r\n', 'Review of Seneca Review "The Lyric Body"', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '88-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-19 21:49:12', '2010-08-20 04:49:12', '', 88, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/88-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Still “embodiment” can represent something more than the site of the psyche’s “agon” — more than the psyche, for that matter. We must conceive of distributed intelligence, what the American poet Charles Olson called proprioception, the body’s understanding of itself in space. Lyric space, lyric relation. Corporeal knowing. Robert Creeley echoes this idea, repeating famously: “The plan is the body / the plan is the body . . . ” In effect, the difficulties stemming from our physical lives are the incitements of wisdom. We have long understood this notion in the context of aging. Kings Solomon and David are said to have grown virtuous on account of their advanced ages. The French say: “Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse pouvait!” If you’re lucky enough to grow old and infirm you may possess some virtues.\r\n\r\nWhat about the bodies that must struggle daily with the body politic? If Crazy Jane is correct, bodies at all ages know something, something we understand as an admixture of sublimations, faiths, despairs, and determinations. There are secrets to the arts of the body and its accentuations are odd. One thinks of the Tao’s “Ecclesiastes”:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There is a time for being ahead,\r\na time for being behind;\r\na time for being in motion;\r\na time for being at rest;\r\na time for being vigorous;\r\na time for being exhausted;\r\na time for being safe;\r\na time for being in danger.\r\n\r\nThe Master sees things as they are,\r\nwithout trying to control them.\r\nShe lets them go their own way,\r\nand resides at the center of the circle.</blockquote>\r\n— <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, Stephen Mitchell translation\r\n\r\nOne may usefully think of the Master as full embodiment, or in Jungian terms as individuation. What the body “knows” must be seen relative to things as they are and not suborned into easy stories of overcoming — the body knows it is all things at once. That this may be seen as a lyric intelligence is surely sensible. The lyric is fractious, ideogrammatic, uncensored, naive and wise, and it proposes that we carry through our lives as well as we can, that we absorb errors, that certain ideals may be undone, that we may get to knowledge by indirection. Embodiment in literary terms is not far from analytical psychology save for this distinction: writers who sense the body’s ways of knowing are not interested in the closures of self-help narratives. The body’s insights are not a compensation. The body offers steep truths all its own. Different truths, truths of difference.', 'The Lyric Body', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '54-revision-10', '', '', '2010-08-19 20:51:02', '2010-08-20 03:51:02', '', 54, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/54-revision-10/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Although he can speak, and does not have to rely on typing, he spent years frustrated and struggling. He was kicked out of regular schools for biting and hitting when he was young, and finally spent a few years in a special school to help him find his focus, and get a fresh start. Now he is attending classes like you are.\r\n\r\nYour story helped me understand something of how my grandson Benjamin feels. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona, and we are in Michellville, Iowa, not far from Grinnell. We are not able to spend much time with him, and I appreciated so much reading about your anxiety, DJ. Thank you.\r\n\r\nBenjamin has "meltdowns" which no one understood for years, because he was lost in the crowd of "ordinary (neurotypical) kids. He was not distinctive enough to be identified as someone with a different way of perceiving life, rather than a naughty, undisciplined boy.\r\n\r\nI knew that Ben was afraid, but not what to do to help. Your book will certainly be a great inspiration to our whole family. Ben counts on his parents, just as you do, DJ.\r\n\r\nHave you read Temple Grandin''s book about herself?

My daughter, an 11-year-old non-speaking, un-house-trained "classical" autist, has been using FC since she was 5, shortly after it was discovered that she had independently taught herself to read. Your arguments and conclusions in the book''s introduction resonate both in the general and, in many cases, with the specific.\r\n\r\nI particularly liked the case of the multi-lingual autist who could be ''tested'' by using non-speakers of the language in use as facilitators, proving the truth of FC. In our case, my daughter has a number of facilitators, but her ''voice'' resolutely remains hers: her fascination with and love of language and the particulars of her phrasing remain consistent, regardless of who is holding her wrist.\r\n\r\nHer ability to communicate abstract thought and her considerable emotional ''literacy'' has, for us, led to a total distrust of autistic stereotypes as promulgated by the scientific community (Wing et al). An example: I suffer from intermittent depression. One day she typed that she found me, in her words, "hard to read. I''m never sure whether you are up or down." This immediately tells me two things: that she is concerned about who and how I am and is attempting to empathize, difficult as that may be (that difficulty stemming from who I am, rather than who she is), and that conversely she is able to "read" other people.\r\n\r\nLike DJ, she often expresses a wish to help, indeed campaign for, autistic people.

She was two when I first met her. As in the United States, children above six months of age have decreasing percentage chances of adoption. By age five, a child, particularly in an overseas orphanage such as my daughter''s, has a one percent chance of finding a forever family. My daughter was displaying autistic type tendencies, as they referred to her behaviors, at the time of her adoption. She also displays scars from physical beatings either with her birth mother the first six months of her life or with orphanage personnel. The overseas doctor was very concerned that we might not want to adopt her with her challenges. Many other families had met her and chose not to. She still has challenging days. What is most amusing is when people comment how ''normal'' my child appears. As if the rest of us are truly ''normal''! I love my child. Her originally labeled autistic type tendencies now are more so likely in another category of neurological. Now that she is has just reached age six, our adoption agency ''up north'' and other experts have recommended that her development is such that testing will now be able to guide us. Either way, she is my child. Yes, these children need our love, as well as we need theirs. My daughter has been the best that has ever happened to me. I''m sure you feel the same about your child.

I just finished it last night. Actually, I was so sucked in by it that it has been my companion every night for the past week. It is rare that I have the opportunity to respond to an author of a memoir who I know in "real life", so I hope you''ll indulge me. I figure you wrote over 400 pages so the least I can do is write a lengthy email.\r\n\r\nThe experience of reading was changed by my remembering of Gainesville, Grinnell, you, your tone of voice and brief references you made in class that were elaborated in the book (such as the story about the poem and Charlie''s stroller). I was even able to picture Emily and DJ (though I never met them formally, I saw them when I was out walking at Krumm one day so I at least have a sketchy image). All of this made the reading experience wholly different.\r\n\r\nI can forgive the GLAD trashbag reference because you quoted my favorite Annie Dillard essay (I keep a copy of it in my desk).\r\n\r\nIt is touching how you intermittently honor Emily in the book like a bird alighting on solid ground before flying off again. You make sure that we don''t forget her part.\r\n\r\nAt the end, when you discover that you don''t want DJ to focus only on trauma and the past and begin to be firm about establishing a different narrative for his life I was reminded of narrative psychotherapy (related, some might say, to constructivist therapy). It strikes me that you and DJ were practicing this kind of therapy. It''s attributed to a guy named White and if you haven''t heard of it you might find it interesting. It''s essentially about honoring people''s humanity by giving them the opportunity to "re-story" old, stuck narratives in a way that is more empowering for their present and future life. I was interested in many of your reflections on psychotherapy since I currently work as a therapist in private practice. (Not to worry- I also still work as a medical social worker with people who have end stage renal disease.)\r\n\r\nI positively cried my eyes out during the parts about Charlie. You write sadness well. To me, those sections are some of the strongest and most effective in the book.\r\n\r\nOf course, I took note of the handful of places where you touch on theology. We never discussed this but you had somewhat of a reputation at Grinnell as being anti-religion (my favorite quote that you uttered one day in class is this: "I don''t have antipathy toward religion, it just leaves me cold.") In the book, I sensed the primary theological theme as being discomfort/anger with the notion of a God who acts either as puppeteer or who refuses to intervene in suffering when he/she could. I agree that this kind of God- omnipotent, controlling- is not worthy of devotion. I also strongly identified with your awkward feelings in the face of religious ritual. Towards the end of the book, when the tone of advocacy became strong, I started to think of Jesus...not roller skating rink blasting Christian music Jesus, but Jesus the friend and advocate of the poor and oppressed. I am opposed to all kinds of interpretations of Jesus- substitutionary atonement, son of God, on and on- but not that one and I thought of it when contemplating your ethic of social responsibility. Yes, all this from someone who spent three years in seminary and has been through an entire denominational ordination process. Call it research into humanity.\r\n\r\nI so admire what you''ve accomplished in this book. The blending of your intelligence and emotion is artful. The courage to allow people to be voyeurs of your life, to lay yourself and your family out on the page in that way (especially in such a small community as Grinnell), is inspiring.\r\n\r\nI will never think of the words "great" "possibly" "free" the same way again.\r\n\r\nBest wishes as you tour around this summer.', 'G.C.', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '230-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-23 13:55:29', '2010-08-23 20:55:29', '', 230, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/230-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

If facilitated communication is a practice meant to enable those who might otherwise go unheard to communicate with the assistance or support of others, then certainly we are all practitioners. As the various poetic invocations of the memoir demonstrate, your own voice is indelibly tied to the devices and inventive potentials of literature and poetry. In that spirit, I would like to conjure a philosophical voice which has augmented my own communication and summarizes my reactions to Reasonable People. This is a statement on pragmatist ethics which I admire for its particular willingness to substitute social and emotional relevancy for technical sophistication. “Moral development in the individual, and moral progress in the human species as a whole, is a matter of re-marking human selves so as to enlarge the variety of relationships which constitute those selves. […] Pragmatists think of moral progress as more like sewing together a very large, elaborate, polychrome quilt, than like getting a clearer vision of something true and deep. […]So it is best to think of moral progress as a matter of increasing sensitivity, increasing responsiveness to the needs of a larger and larger variety of people and things” (R. Rorty, Ethics without Principles, 1994).\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of Reasonable People is to confront social injustice through the life and actions of one family, without becoming politically sterile. The memoir inspires moral indignation and reasonable political expectations that we can all contribute to a more inclusive and egalitarian society with efforts that are neither heroic nor unreasonable, but simply sensible individuals encouraged by compassion and interested in building a more creative and diverse social landscape which enriches our own lives. Americans are often ready to make ‘easy reading’ of memoirs such as Reasonable People, but the unique virtue of this work is that it denies its readers a packaged tale of triumph in adversity, and demands a confrontation with the circumstances of poverty in a collapsing welfare state, and the oftentimes inequitable perceptions of disability and difference which permeate our social (and scientific) lives. You will have to forgive the clumsiness of my evaluation and expression (as I lack any literary training), but Reasonable People is simply a beautiful act of impassioned love and rage. You managed to capture the almost oppressive sense of hopelessness and frustration which you, Emily, and DJ at times faced, while simultaneously capturing the enduring love and hope which paradoxically filled those same moments.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to add a word to DJ. If his dream is to become a political freedom fighter, then he has certainly achieved more with respect to his aspirations than many of us can hope to do in a lifetime. In showing the courage to allow his story to be told, he has shown the determination and fearless spirit which it takes to inspire radical political action.

Somehow the idea of having them in the house made our suspicions, and then the emerging reality, seem more intense. But the ice had to melt, and eventually I broke down and bought Greenspan''s <em>The Child With Special Needs</em>, and then <em>The Out-Of-Sync Child</em>, desperately trying to understand how our son was like the children described in those books. But he wasn''t, really, not in any clear-cut way, and the whole idea that he might be "on the spectrum" filled us with equal parts dread and confusion.\r\n\r\nThat didn''t stop me from sidling over to the children''s section in the bookstore from time to time, then furtively paging through <em>Quirky Kids</em> and <em>The Maverick Mind</em> and countless others to see if any struck a chord. But I''d always leave the store empty-handed and a little shaken. Is this really us? Am I missing something? The first memoir I read was Paul Collins'' <em>Not Even Wrong</em> (love him; reading <em>Sixpence House</em> now, which is about reading, not autism), and then Kamran Nazeer''s <em>Send in the Idiots</em>, and then one day, in an effort to find a bit of serenity, Susan Senator''s <em>Making Peace with Autism</em>. Around that time, J. and I started to ease up on the whole is-he-or-isn''t-he debate, and accept that a) if there is a spectrum, he''s on it; b) this is, in J''s words, "current events, not prophecy" and c) none of this changes who my son is: a smart, delightful, funny, loving boy.\r\n\r\nWhat were we resisting? That he was different from other children? No, that was pretty clear. That he has difficulties with speech, and motor planning, and sensory integration, and social situations? No, we got that. That we needed to give him as much therapy as we could reasonably fit into his life--and ours? No, he had a full program of therapies by the time he was two and a half. That we should limit our expectations? That he might never be independent? That he didn''t have empathy? That we should just accept all the received wisdom about what a child with autism spectrum disorder can do and will become? That our life as we knew it was over? No. No. No. No. No. We didn''t, and don''t, accept any of that. He''s given us no reason to; in fact, he''s full of surprises.\r\n\r\nSo I was delighted to find a link to Ralph Savarese''s LA Times editorial on Mom-NOS''s blog a couple of weeks ago (thanks, Mom!), in which he espouses a joyful, optimistic and, I believe, respectful model for parenting a child with special needs. I was even more delighted to read his book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em> this past week. Let me say this upfront: it is not a book to pick up lightly. It''s about intense commitment: commitment to a child with autism whose biological parents were unable or unwilling to care for him, who had suffered extreme neglect and abuse, who did not speak, and who, with the aid of his adoptive parents'' incredible love and persistence and ingenuity and patience, learns to communicate independently, reflect on his past, participate and excel in school and give us a glimpse--more than a glimpse--into what autism feels like from the inside.\r\n\r\nHeroic? Heartwarming? A triumph of the human spirit? I would say yes, actually, but that''s not at all what Savarese is after. Like any thoughtful memoirist, he resists the narcissism inherent in the form, and it gnaws at him throughout the book. He doesn''t want to be praised or idealized. He''s not looking for the easy out. He insists meticulously on detailing his own doubts, faults, frailties through the process of bonding with, adopting and raising his son DJ. He doesn''t shy from political, cultural, psychological, even literary analysis of autism and disability. He wants us to see it all: the anguish, the confusion, the joys, the mistakes, the odd trajectories of progress and regression.\r\n\r\nMost stunning about this book is that, through the process of facilitated communication (in which he types his thoughts with some slight physical assistance from his parents), DJ becomes able to express himself and thus tell his own story. Savarese includes many of DJ''s thoughts, poems and school assignments throughout the book, up to and including the final chapter, which is DJ''s work entirely (I did find myself wishing that his wife had had a chapter too). I won''t go into the whole facilitated communication debate here (Savarese covers that in great detail), but I was touched to hear this lovely boy''s voice as he wrestled with the circumstances of his life and of his own identity, finally coming to a kind of peace.

Writer Ralph James Savarese, the adoptive father of 12-year-old DJ, is the latest to pen a saga of what it''s like to live with autism.\r\n\r\nOne keen insight Savarese brings to the table is that autism is universally perceived with reference to average human beings as the norm. To the extent that an autist''s behavior deviates from that norm, we treat it as a disease to be cured. Within the growing autism community, however, a movement is growing to portray it as a way of life rather than as a disease to be cured.\r\n\r\nConsider my six-year-old grandson Toby, for example. He was diagnosed autistic four years ago, and intensive one-on-one therapy since then has allowed him to speak fluently, to relate to others to some degree, and to function in a mainstream first-grade classroom, albeit with the presence of aides. His perseverative behavior -- hand-flapping  and obsessively repetitive behavior, for example -- has lessened markedly. But his parents realize that Toby will likely need supportive help of some kind for the rest of his life, even though a realistic expectation is that he''ll be able to live independently as an adult.\r\n\r\nBut like many high-functioning autists, Toby exhibits strong signs of Asperger''s Syndrome -- a savant quality that enables him to run rings around kids his own age in certain specific areas. He''s long been fascinated with maps and regularly studies the schematic route maps of the MBTA system in his hometown of Boston. He can direct a driver, street by street, from his home to that of his grandparents in Hartford, something his highly talented 10 year old cousin would be at a loss to do. The point of all this is that we can learn from and value people with autism for their own impressive gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen the author adopted DJ at age 6, he was entirely non-verbal and seemed unable to communicate. Six years later, he still doesn''t speak but types fluently, aspires to become a writer, and even wrote the last chapter of the book. While parts of that chapter can be difficult to understand -- Toby edited it himself -- it provides a wonderful window into his mind. He has a profound distaste for testing, for example, and characteristic of autistic people, he seems to have made that distaste a somewhat obsessive fixation.\r\n\r\nOne highly useful construct Savarese employs is to compare DJ''s situation with that of the genius Stephen Hawking, who though non-verbal because he has Lou Gehrig''s Disease, has learned to type on a computer by moving his eyes.  So basically, Hawking and DJ started from the common condition of having something to say but needing help to get it out.

You''re not bringing hard real lessons to girls and boys at your school, so they can become awesome great human beings.\r\n\r\nDad has written a book about my fresh start. I''ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind and fresh start could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren''t assessing me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of trying to responsibly act like everyone deserving respect.\r\n\r\nQuite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up better boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing. You''re also resurrected in my mind when all I''m doing is wasting time. Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get mad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re smart; testing kids without encouraging them is wrong. Easy, quiet breathing waits to hear my words, and respect grows. Awesome, caring teachers read my writing and reward me by writing back. Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really can understand. Teach your students to free themselves from resentment, so they desire to feel respected. Re-estimate them as smart. Read, write, and free the hearts and minds of these kids!\r\n\r\nIn the future, possibly, you will read my own books. I plan to become a writer. I wrote a chapter in my dad''s book already. In it I include my thoughts about testing. In the future I hope to encourage students who don''t speak to free themselves through writing. I also hope to read my speeches out loud. Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future.

The book is told memoir-style, telling the story of what it has been like thus far for Savarese and his wife, Emily, an autism inclusion expert, to raise their adopted son, DJ. However, though the main tale is that of life with DJ, Savarese uses this as a platform for the discussion of many larger societal issues that affect us all, whether we know someone with autism or not, (though clearly pretty much anyone reading this blog does.)\r\n\r\nThe first issue, or rather, the first set of issues, he talks about are those of poverty, foster care, and adoption. He discusses in detail his own initial desire to not have children, because doing so would limit his ability to take part in the wider world and would not allow him to devote his time to altruistic causes he believed in. When they first met DJ, he and his wife were devoted to getting DJ and his sister back into their biological mother''s care. Throughout the narration of their prolonged relationship with Rhonda, in which they helped her both financially and in the court system, Savarese also discusses many of the thoughts he had about the cyclic nature of poverty and his desire to see it truly confronted as a societal problem in which everyone needs to take an interest, because it is everyone''s responsibility as a whole. He continued this discussion in his description of the foster care system, in which many of the families providing foster care are poor families doing it for the childcare stipend. He notes that this draws an inadvertent, sometimes antagonistic divide, often along class lines, between prospective adoptive families and foster care families. His stark look at the foster care and state adoption systems reveal a need for change, but also a realistic look at how overtaxed the systems are, being a essentially stopgap measure for addressing much larger societal problems.\r\n\r\nOnce Savarese and his wife succeed in adopting DJ, they are determined to get him into an inclusive educational setting. Up to that point, he had attended a closed center school, in which he had made little progress. Thanks to Emily''s own inclusion expertise and both of the determination of them both to prevail over the school system, they succeeded, and DJ began on the road to literacy and learning. The arguments presented between Emily and the schools, both the center school and the public elementary school, are classic, and powerful, examples of the argument over inclusion. As one can tell from the chapter at the end of the book, though, DJ is most definitely a proponent of inclusive environments, which he makes clear in a letter addressed to his old preschool teachers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things DJ gains from his new intensive educational experiences is literacy. As it turns out, literacy opens many avenues of communication for DJ, because he says he didn''t learn to decode spoken language until he learned to read. Their efforts towards literacy also led to an inadvertent discovery of facilitated communication (FC), and Savarese spends some time defending the method in its legitimate form, discussing the controversy that surrounded it in the early ''90s, but presenting powerful evidence of research done since then proving its efficacy when used appropriately. He also mentions numerous successful users of FC, who now lead quite rich lives and are able to advocate for themselves. DJ looks well on the way to becoming one of these vocal, or should we say, typing advocates. Indeed, DJ, as well as his parents, have discovered the world of disability/identity politics, and these play a strong role in their story.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the things that makes this book so unique amongst the available books on autism, aside from its focus on adoption, is its exploration of the relationship between trauma and autism. DJ was severely physically and sexually abused by another child in foster care, and it was only after he learned to communicate that he seemed able to assimilate and understand this part of his past. This led to many problems with anxiety, anger, confusion, and separation. Dealing with this through therapy was much more complicated when combined with autism and communicating via FC, and Savarese describes many of the issues they and their therapists faced in dealing with something relatively unknown. Many of the standard therapy techniques became problems in and of themselves, as DJ began to perseverate on his past trauma, rather than moving through the memories to the other side. In addition, the more anxious and upset he became, the more violent and less communicative he would become. The combination of trauma, in this case PTSD, and autism is not a field that has been widely explored, and this book can be considered a call for more attention and research. Savarese points out that the nonverbal in our population are far more likely to suffer abuse, and this problem is probably much more widespread than we would like to think.\r\n\r\nThough Savarese also writes movingly about the meaning of family, particularly in relation to the bond between DJ and his biological sister; dealing with loss in many forms; the relationship between poetry and DJ''s unique perceptions of the world; and numerous other things, I fear that I have run on for too long already, so I''ll simply end here with a recommendation that everyone read this book. Truly, it is a moving, fascinating, and of course remarkably well-written book, and I am sad to have had to condense it this much.', 'Autism Society of North Carolina Bookstore', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '176-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-23 10:48:55', '2010-08-23 17:48:55', '', 176, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/176-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

DJ had been abandoned by his birth father, and neglected and abused by his alcoholic birth mother. He''d been sodomized and further abused in an overcrowded fostercare home where an adolescent boy, also a victim of sexual abuse, had tried to work through his own trauma by violating the then-speechless-thus-perfect-victim, DJ,\r\n\r\nThe story retraces the Savareses'' journey through the twisted legal terrain of fostercare adoption, and into the pioneering territory of full-inclusion for DJ in a public school, in the least-restrictive educational setting, the contested terrain of facilitated communication, and the heartwrenching reunions of DJ and his birth sister — the child who had taken care of her little brother when addiction had rendered their birth mother incapable of mother-work. Through uncompromising love and commitment to DJ and his personhood, the Savareses create a home that is safe enough for DJ to reveal — in his own typed messages — the magnitude of the abuse he''d suffered in fostercare. I did skip ahead to read the last chapter, written by DJ himself, so I know that there is an amazing conclusion, if not a saccharin-laced smiley-faced happy ending.\r\n\r\nWhile there is much to love in this book and this family (pictured here), and much to discuss about it, what appeals so profoundly to me in the story is Savarese''s unwillingness to throw out the baby with the bathwater, whether that baby is his son, a commitment to inclusion and the principle of the least restrictive setting, or the emancipatory possibilities of psychoanalysis — a theory that has a well-deserved bad reputation in the autism world, saddled as it has been with the legacy of mother-blaming encapsulated in Bettelheim''s "refrigerator mother" hypothesis.\r\n\r\nI have been grappling with this very theoretical issue in my own more work, wondering what to do with psychoanalysis, and wondering what atypical language acquistion means for the development of structures like the unconscious and desire. Like Savarese, I came of age intellectually in the cultural studies milieu of the late 1980s and 90s and was steeped in a heady brew of psychoanalytic theory, dialectical materialism, and feminism.\r\n\r\nAutism parenting has challenged each of these frameworks, but none more aggressively than psychoanalytic theory. I''d backburnered my questions about this until recently, when my psychoanalytic reading group had asked me to present a paper about autism and psychoanalysis at a regional conference in February. I had agreed, and then, still conflicted about the role of psychoanalysis in autism''s misrepresentation, I was sick the weekend of the conference and wound up not going. Conflict can do that to any body.\r\n\r\nSavarese''s narrative, healing for himself and his family, has been similarly healing for me. With an easier integration of my lived experience and theoretical models, I hope to be able to present that paper this summer at a national conference — thanks to Savarese and his intellectual and emotional integrity.\r\n\r\nAnd more on Reasonable People in the days to come . . . 100 or so enveloping pages to go.', 'Autism''s Edges', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '172-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-23 10:00:25', '2010-08-23 17:00:25', '', 172, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/172-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Is ginger the sort of fuel you use . . . to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? . . .

We''ll teach you how to drug a harpooner, none of your apothecary''s medicine here.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow recall the moment in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" when the lawyer meditates on Bartleby''s peculiar eating habits:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I: never eats a dinner, properly speaking . . . My mind ran on in reveries concerning the probably effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts . . . Now, what was ginger"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDespite the nearly seven hundred essays on Mellville''s famous story, this striking parallel has remained untreated.  Such an omission would seem more understandable if Melville hadn''t engaged the topic of patent medicine in other works from the 1850x.  In <em>The Confidence Man</em>, for example, Melville devotes several chapters to the dealings of an herb doctor who prescribes "Omni-Balsamic Reinvigorator" and "Samaritan Pain Dissuader" to passengers on a steamboat ironically name <em>Fidele</em>.  There, Stubb''s skepticism in the face of such medicine finds expression in the voice of a Missouri bachelor who derides one of the herb doctor''s patients: "Yarbs, yarbs; natur, natur; you foolish old file you!  He diddles you with that hocus-pocus, did he?  Yarbs and nature will cure your incurlable cough, you think" (NN <em>CM</em> 106).  Directly connecting the phenomenon of herbal medicine to the novel''s central conceit of the confidence game, Mellville even has the Missourian remark, "I have confidence in distrust; more particularly as applied to you and your herbs" (108).  Finally, in "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!" a story with references to steamboat and railroad disasters, a less skeptical but much more desperate narrator speaks of money as "a drug in the market," lamenting, "But blame me if I can get any of the drug, though there never was a sick man more in need of that particular sort of medicine" (NN <em>Plazza Tales Tales</em> 270).  Checking his pockets, the narrator then declares, "Ha! here''s a powder I was going to send the sick baby in yonder hovel, where the Irish ditcher lives."\r\n\r\nClearly, Melville is playing games with patent medicines in his fiction from the 1850s.  This essay seeks to answer the lawyer''s question in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- "Now, what was ginger?" -- as a way of trying to elucidate the scrivener''s mysterious rebellion, and it assumes from the outset that the lawyer cannot possibly answer his own question.  Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="http://www.ralphsavarese.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Nervous_Wrecks_and_Ginger_Nuts-Ralph_Savarese.pdf">"Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts" (PDF)</a>', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts: Bartleby at a Standstill', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'nervous-wrecks-and-ginger-nuts', '', '', '2011-08-07 15:06:23', '2011-08-07 22:06:23', '', 0, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/?p=609', 0, 'post', '', 0);

There is lots of evidence on both sides of the debate.  What I’d ask of skeptics is to keep an open mind while investigating the phenomenon.  Most people do not realize that there are now studies that confirm, or partially confirm, the technique’s efficacy with at least some non-speaking people with autism.  Nor do they realize that a growing number of users have weaned themselves from their facilitators’ support and are now typing independently.  Some who still require support have successfully passed message-passing protocols.  Some have even learned to speak through typing!  If Doug Biklen, Director of the Facilitated Communication Institute and Dean of Syracuse University’s School of Education, can post on the Institute’s web site studies that have both proven and disproven FC, then the technique’s critics ought to be able to confront the new developments I mention above.  Let’s have a full and honest discussion.  As part of that discussion, let’s consider new research from Morton Gernsbacher and Laurent Mottron that suggests we have been using the wrong tests to measure intelligence and “theory of mind” in people with autism.  By changing the testing vehicles, research subjects were able to score much higher than before, rendering the claim of mental retardation and lack of social awareness in a vast majority of people with autism quite dubious.  If scientists have fundamentally misunderstood autism, then it is not so unreasonable to imagine that FC might work—at least for some.    \r\n\r\nReaders of my book will see that Emily and I spent years teaching DJ how to be literate.  Only when he “proved” his competence by pointing independently at answers on a page or blackboard did everyone—parents, teachers, aides—feel comfortable with the notion of facilitated communication.  (If a person is not literate, FC can’t possibly work.)  Some critics have suggested that we should have waited to publish this story after DJ had achieved independence. I would respond that independent typing can take years to accomplish and, moreover, that some might never be able to accomplish it for reasons that are still unclear.  The idea of waiting for total independence at the keyboard before one accepts the communication of people with classical autism is both cruel and unfair.  At the same time, one has to be very careful about facilitator influence. \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a project that looks at DJ’s and others’ communication in a manner akin to how literary scholars determine whether a newly discovered poem might be that of a particular author—by doing statistical analyses of diction, syntax, figures of speech, etc.  DJ has multiple facilitators (some fifteen) and his very idiosyncratic style remains the same across this group.  So, in addition to naïve facilitators producing information that they could not have known, they produce it in a style that is consistent, though the facilitators themselves could not be more different with regard to age, gender, income level, educational background, and political convictions.  Along with message-passing tests, this sort of corroboration should lend more credence to FC.  If scholars in the contentious field of literary studies can come to a consensus about a new Shakespeare poem, perhaps psychologists, neurologists, special-ed teachers and the like can come to a consensus about the efficacy of facilitated communication with some non-speaking people with autism.  I should say that I am also commencing a study of this idiosyncratic style itself—what I call the “neuro-poetics of autistic discourse.”  A version of it shows up in many non-speaking people with autism.  By emphasizing the beauty of such communication, we can all push back against the tendency to pathologize difference.\r\n\r\nWith respect to DJ’s writings on this web site and in the book, I would underscore DJ’s capacity, when pushed, to mimic neuro-typical discourse, though not completely.  In his Justin Dart term paper, for instance, you can still see traces of his idiosyncratic diction: “Dart’s accomplishments are too numerous to freshly detail.”  “Fresh” is one of DJ’s favorite words, and it shows up in all sorts of places and in all sorts of unexpected ways. “Dad has written a book about my fresh start,” he writes in a letter to the teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him.  When left to his own devices—that is, when simply conversing—he produces a version of DJ speak, as in his “Note to Dad”: “Yes.dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me.  yes.  yes.  yes.  yes.”  As with any neuro-typical child who is simply conversing, we don’t pressure DJ to produce perfect English when he is typing.  With his school assignments, however, we encourage him to conform to the conventions of standard English.  We have marveled at his capacity to do this—he is a straight “A” language arts students—while preserving some aspects of his style.  He has an uncanny ability to organize his thoughts; he understands how an argument works, and these skills only continue to improve.  But there is still something there that is distinctly atypical about his communication, something irreducibly him.  So, on the web site and in the book you will see a range of writings, produced at different ages and with different objectives in mind.  Some things—whether poems or school assignments—have been extensively revised (by him); others have not.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to address the critics who, without having read the book (they acknowledge as much), have said some particular noxious things about DJ’s experience of sexual abuse.  There is no doubt that facilitated communication became enmeshed in the recovered memory controversy of the early-to-mid-1990s when claims of sexual abuse ran wild.  There were FC users who typed allegations of sexual abuse that were clearly untrue, but there were also some users who typed legitimate allegations.  Some of these allegations have even stood up in court.  Here’s what we know about DJ: he was viciously attacked in foster care at the age of three by a much older boy whose father had sexually abused him.  The authorities worried enough about sexual abuse in DJ’s attack that they specifically asked the doctor who was attending to his physical injuries to look for signs of sexual violation.  Though the doctor found none, she admitted that she wasn’t at all familiar with male rape.  Emily and I never once mentioned this possibility precisely because we feared planting the idea in his head.  Years later, after DJ was literate and began working through his past, he reported to multiple naïve facilitators that he had been raped.  If critics of FC want to imagine that Emily and I have “dirty minds,” they should talk to the psychiatrist and psychologists who treated DJ and were absolutely convinced that he had been sexual traumatized.  People do a terrible injustice to defenseless kids in foster care, where sexual abuse is high, when they gratuitously and maliciously dismiss their unspeakable agony.', 'About Facilitated Communication', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '204-revision-4', '', '', '2010-08-23 12:26:07', '2010-08-23 19:26:07', '', 204, 'http://grantcuster.com/savarese/uncategorized/204-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(604, 1, '2010-08-28 14:20:32', '2010-08-28 21:20:32', 'October 7, 2007 - I reached the elegant 1896 home of Ralph Savarese early and circled the block past Grinnell College, wondering why I was anxious about going in. I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations. He is sensitive to how others speak to his son and how they generalize about his disability.\r\n\r\nSon DJ, 15, would be coming home shortly from his second day of the new school year. He has autism.\r\n\r\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the\r\nprofessionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and\r\npuzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and\r\nunpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began\r\ntalking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h4>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h4>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children\r\nwere taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on\r\nthe failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe\r\nautism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and\r\nyears of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to\r\nconverse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own\r\ncranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t\r\nwant to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few\r\nwill do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the\r\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and\r\ncompulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away.\r\nAfter several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the\r\nhospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy.\r\nAt the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h4>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa-\r\nHenderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now\r\nteaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the\r\ndiagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also\r\nremains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing.\r\nI asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a\r\nstraight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There\r\nare frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe\r\ninsecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at\r\nodds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which\r\ntalks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had\r\nbecome stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be\r\nreasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for\r\nreasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople.\r\ncom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown,\r\nsquealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been\r\nworking on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these\r\nvery hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his\r\nplace in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged\r\nhim to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York\r\nliterary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with\r\nautism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting\r\nhopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the\r\nanxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up\r\nbetter boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will\r\nhave to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get\r\nmad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re\r\nsmart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\r\ncan understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future. Years of fresh start have begun!\r\n\r\nYour respectful student,\r\nDJ Savarese"', 'Des Moines Register', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '187-revision-4', '', '', '2010-08-28 14:20:32', '2010-08-28 21:20:32', '', 187, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/187-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Just as people with physical disabilities have insisted on the right to self-representation and determination, so, too, have people with autism — and not just those who are termed "high-functioning." As it advances a notion of “a complicated, ambiguous impairment,” the special issue tries hard to embody the principle of self-representation. Half of the nearly forty contributors are on the autism spectrum; any number of them carries the label of "severely autistic." Some do not speak, or speak in a limited way, and instead type or write to communicate. The work of these contributors appears in every section of the special issue: refereed articles, cultural commentaries, reviews, interviews, and roundtables.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about autism, let us dispense with rigid binaries: either difference or disability.  As Phil Schwarz argues, “The mainstream speaks of autism primarily in the medical language of deficit, and cannot see, as many of us on the spectrum do, that once the right kinds of support, accommodation, and mitigation of specific handicaps are available, there are desirable aspects to autism that we would not want to live without.” Or as Tito Mukhopadhyay puts it:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So what if a Theory\r\nSays something\r\nIt doesn''t change for sure\r\nAny — Thing.\r\nI may be that\r\nAnd I may be this...\r\nWho Cares anyway?\r\nI am a Proud Autistic.</blockquote>', 'Autism and the Concept of Neurodiversity', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '58-revision-5', '', '', '2010-08-30 10:30:11', '2010-08-30 17:30:11', '', 58, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/58-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.\r\n\r\nEmily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.\r\n\r\nAs the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:\r\n\r\n“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”\r\n\r\nIt pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:\r\n\r\n“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,\r\n\r\n“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”\r\n\r\nAs DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”\r\n\r\nThere may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,\r\n\r\n‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”\r\n\r\nRalph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.\r\n\r\n“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”\r\n\r\nIn Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.\r\n\r\nFor all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:\r\n\r\n“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations. This is, however, a story about what life is all about: trial, error, perseverance, and faith in people. Faith in love. Ralph, Emily and DJ give us that, and much more.', 'The Joy of Autism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '183-revision-5', '', '', '2010-09-20 20:59:12', '2010-09-21 03:59:12', '', 183, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/183-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Is ginger the sort of fuel you use . . . to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? . . . The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward and apothecary, sir? . . . We''ll teach you how to drug a harpooner, none of your apothecary''s medicine here.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow recall the moment in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" when the lawyer meditates on Bartleby''s peculiar eating habits:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I: never eats a dinner, properly speaking . . . My mind ran on in reveries concerning the probably effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts . . . Now, what was ginger"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDespite the nearly seven hundred essays on Mellville''s famous story, this striking parallel has remained untreated.  Such an omission would seem more understandable if Melville hadn''t engaged the topic of patent medicine in other works from the 1850x.  In <em>The Confidence Man</em>, for example, Melville devotes several chapters to the dealings of an herb doctor who prescribes "Omni-Balsamic Reinvigorator" and "Samaritan Pain Dissuader" to passengers on a steamboat ironically name <em>Fidele</em>.  There, Stubb''s skepticism in the face of such medicine finds expression in the voice of a Missouri bachelor who derides one of the herb doctor''s patients: "Yarbs, yarbs; natur, natur; you foolish old file you!  He diddles you with that hocus-pocus, did he?  Yarbs and nature will cure your incurlable cough, you think" (NN <em>CM</em> 106).  Directly connecting the phenomenon of herbal medicine to the novel''s central conceit of the confidence game, Mellville even has the Missourian remark, "I have confidence in distrust; more particularly as applied to you and your herbs" (108).  Finally, in "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!" a story with references to steamboat and railroad disasters, a less skeptical but much more desperate narrator speaks of money as "a drug in the market," lamenting, "But blame me if I can get any of the drug, though there never was a sick man more in need of that particular sort of medicine" (NN <em>Plazza Tales Tales</em> 270).  Checking his pockets, the narrator then declares, "Ha! here''s a powder I was going to send the sick baby in yonder hovel, where the Irish ditcher lives."\r\n\r\nClearly, Melville is playing games with patent medicines in his fiction from the 1850s.  This essay seeks to answer the lawyer''s question in "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- "Now, what was ginger?" -- as a way of trying to elucidate the scrivener''s mysterious rebellion, and it assumes from the outset that the lawyer cannot possibly answer his own question.  Instead, it leans on the witty "distrust" of these other works in order to flesh out the story''s implicit critique, to see where indeed <em>lies</em> the virtue of ginger.\r\n\r\nRead the rest of <a href="ftp://grantcuster.com/savarese/wp-content/themes/twentyten/Uploads/Ralph-Savarese--Nervous-Wrecks-and-Ginger-nuts.pdf">"Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts" (PDF)</a>', 'Nervous Wrecks and Ginger-nuts', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '609-revision-3', '', '', '2010-09-17 12:33:48', '2010-09-17 19:33:48', '', 609, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/609-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

He writes:\r\n\r\nTo many experts, the non-speaking Autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.\r\n\r\nTo be autistic and to be non-verbal was once, Savarese suggests, to be a kind of human black hole, a bottomless, empty, mysterious nothingness that took in information and stimuli and never did anything it. And this is, I suspect and I know, how my son, Charlie, would have been regarded had he been born fifty years ago, forty, twenty; and this is how DJ, Savarese’s adopted autistic son, might still be regarded had he not been taught to type the words inside of him.\r\n\r\nSavarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> tells many stories: How DJ came into his parents-to-be’s lives in Florida; how DJ suffered in the “care” of a foster parent; how Savarese becomes a father; how 9-year-old DJ, after several years of hand-over-hand typing, emerges into “full-blown communication.” DJ is now a straight-A honor roll student in middle school in a town in south-central Iowa. And DJ wrote the final chapter (”It’s My Story”) of Savarese’s book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em>. Just because a child—an autistic child—cannot speak, cannot express himself orally—-does not mean that he cannot speak, as this book by Savarese and by DJ shows. The black hole is not so bleak, not so silent, after all. \r\n\r\nSavarese, who teaches American literature and creative writing at Grinnell College, begins Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption by describing the new version of the black hole: Rather than swallowing up all particles, all information, forever, black holes are now said to allow information to escape. Savarese quotes no less an expert on these matters than physicist Stephen Hawking—-indeed, he refers to an incident in July of 2004, in which Hawking officially conceded a bet to his Cal-Tech colleague, John Preskill. "As the headline from the Technology and Science page of the MSNBC website put it, ''Hawking changes his mind on black holes: Galactic traps may actually allow information to escape.'' At the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, Ireland, Hawking presented Preskill with a book: <em>Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia</em>. In doing so, the world’s most famous physicist mocked his own theory with an object from which, in the words of one reporter, “information is easily retrieved.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption</em> is a gripping narrative of how DJ came into his and his wife Emily’s life, of how autism came into his life; of how a child who many “experts” had written off, has himself learned to write and can tell his own story.

We adopted her five years ago, and she came to us with special needs—ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and various other issues. My mantra—"she’s easy to love, but hard to raise"—is inadequate in describing either the intense love and joy or the chaos and exhaustion she’s brought to my life.\r\n\r\n<em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em>, by Ralph James Savarese (Other Press; $25.95), states—clearly, concisely, and with passion—why some people adopt.

DJ has autism. He doesn’t speak, and he experienced severe trauma before joining his family. Woven into the story of their adoption journey, the challenges and triumphs they’ve shared along the way, are Savarese’s treatises on the politics of differing abilities, foster care and adoption, and the meaning of family.\r\n\r\nIt’s an intellectually (morally, ideologically) challenging read. But to say it’s "worth the challenge" would imply that I had to slog through it. That’s not true—I could hardly put it down. DJ, who now practices "facilitated communication," using a computer, wrote the final chapter himself. "I resent these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone," he writes. It isn’t easy reading, DJ. It’s life-changing reading.\r\n\r\nI e-mailed Savarese, hoping for a quote I could include in my review. Reading it gave me shivers. It will tell you, more clearly than I ever could, why you should read the book.\r\n\r\nIn the author’s words:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I hate the fetish of blood relations. Not only does it make adopted children and families feel like second-class citizens, but it perniciously tells us that our ethical obligations extend no further than our natural (as opposed to artificial) ties. So screw the homeless man on the street or the poor family on the other side of town. So long as I''m good to my mother, well, then, I''m a good person. Baloney! We need to open our eyes to the predicaments of those less fortunate; we need to look beyond the walls of the gated community that is often the blood family. More creative family making might actually help us to realize the sentimental trope of the “human family.”\r\n\r\nFor my wife and me, adoption was a FIRST-resort adventure in responding to the desperate plight of a badly abused, wordless little boy. This boy has given us MORE than we have given him. Has it been exhausting? You bet; the most exhausting and challenging and anxiety-producing thing I have ever done. Ever. But also the most rewarding.\r\n\r\nWhy are we on this planet? I believe to grow in our capacity to care and attend to human suffering. By stretching ourselves, sometimes beyond measure, we find a joy that approximates wisdom. My wife and I are NOT saints and don''t appreciate being compared to such beings. Our relationship has suffered. We don''t have time for the many things we used to do. But whose relationship hasn''t suffered with the arrival of kids, whether adopted or not?

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\r\n\r\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\r\n\r\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\r\n\r\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\r\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\r\n\r\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently. Since the eighteenth century, the criteria for human species membership have been determined in great part by mental capacity and especially linguistic capability. Whether those in whom linguistic capability is compromised will be accorded a full set of human rights surfaces as the foremost question whenever non-verbal cognitive impairment comes under scrutiny. Indirectly addressing the issue is Gayatri Spivak''s 1988 essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in which she investigates whether the historically marginalized, colonized people truly are empowered to speak. For Spivak, the subaltern must be able to voice challenges to mistaken assumptions. Especially in the last thirty years, people with physical disabilities at least have spoken up for themselves through disability autobiography. G. Thomas Couser describes this genre as "an anti-colonial phenomenon, a form of autoethnography, as Mary Louise Pratt has defined it: ''instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in way that engage with [read: contest] the colonizer''s own terms.''" If people with physical disabilities can represent themselves and ''talk back'' to the hegemonic ablist culture through autobiography, how is a non-verbal person with a mental disability to do the same? In the grown-up-driven genre of the parental memoir, the adult speaks for the child. Consequently, with regard to these memoirs, a central concern for a reader coming from a disability rights perspective will be the degree of contact afforded between reader and child by the mediating parent-author.\r\n\r\nSavarese follows Oe''s lead by opening a space for DJ to present himself to the reader: the young man contributes the sixteenth and final chapter entitled "It''s My Story!" The memoir''s first fifteen chapters really serve as prologue, explaining how DJ''s chapter came to be written. It is from this section in fact that the title Reasonable People derives; DJ writes, "I''m reasonable. Polite people make me feel comfortable. Which by the way isn''t very often. Reasonable people promote very very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me." Of the way he should be treated, he states, "People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind." Of the self-esteem beginning to shape up within him, he proclaims that "Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, kind, mighty, very smart self." In another passage he associates himself with the civil rights movement, and in another he contests the culturally fabricated assumptions of the neurotypical majority about people like him. At one point he even ''talks back'' to his former teachers in Florida, criticizing them sharply with regard to the education he received: "[Y]ears of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start could have begun sooner."\r\n\r\nWhat G. Thomas Couser observes of such texts as the 1994 <em>Count Us In:Growing Up with Down Syndrome</em> by Jason Kingsley and Mitchell Levitz could be extended to DJ''s chapter: "the very existence of first-person narratives makes its own point: that people with condition ''X'' are capable of self-representation. The autobiographical act models the agency and self-determination that the disability rights movement has fought for." Like Spivak''s subaltern, the purportedly nonverbal person with an intellectual disability not only can but will speak. In at least four ways this book makes a significant contribution to the national conversation on autism and to Disability Studies. First, "It''s My Story!" can be excerpted and read as a freestanding essay, perhaps in some future anthology of writing by people with learning disabilities. But even if such an anthology never materializes, this powerful piece of first-person exposition should find its way onto the reading lists of university-level Education and Cultural Disability Studies courses. It may be appropriate high school reading as well. Second, the book in its entirety can educate parents, teachers, and psychologists, encouraging them to experiment with Emily and Ralph''s techniques that worked so well with DJ. Third, it will reawaken interest in FC, by means of which DJ has been empowered to contest his supposedly ''non-verbal'' status. And fourth, those who read it will be forced to think twice about the various conventional wisdoms associated with autism, to expand their thinking, and in the end, hopefully, to reconsider "what is possible."', 'Disability Studies Quarterly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '189-revision-4', '', '', '2010-08-28 14:20:26', '2010-08-28 21:20:26', '', 189, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/189-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I''d done thousands of interviews over the years with arrogant doctors and lawyers, media-weary celebrities and politicians, threatening convicts and crack addicts on the street.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a creative-writing professor at the college, but the atmosphere would be thick with expectations. He is sensitive to how others speak to his son and how they generalize about his disability.\r\n\r\nSon DJ, 15, would be coming home shortly from his second day of the new school year. He has autism.\r\n\r\nDJ is the centerpiece of Savarese''s powerful new book, "Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption." Its premise appeared made for Disney. Savarese chronicled how he and wife Emily adopted a 6-year-old boy with autism so severe that he wore diapers and responded little to communication.\r\n\r\nThe story was far from Disney.\r\n\r\nSavarese laid out in raw detail the nine-year struggle to help a boy communicate and function, to go to school and have friends, to trust the world again after his abuse in foster care.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Savarese railed against injustice to disabled people, against even the\r\nprofessionally recognized categorization of autism on a scale of "low functioning" to "high functioning," and the notion that the greatest goal is to "cure" autism. He sees it as a gift.\r\n\r\n"We give up on all sorts of people," he said in a National Public Radio interview.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times urging Americans to adopt the half-million special-needs children instead of traveling overseas to find kids.\r\n\r\nHe recoiled at the word "normal," preferring "neurotypical."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I would use the wrong words.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real anxiety was talking with a young boy who is both astounding and\r\npuzzling, a boy who had just come to life over 442 pages, a boy with keen insight and\r\nunpredictable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I walked in, Savarese was, in his words, highly revved himself. He began\r\ntalking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \r\n\r\n<h4>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h4>\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children\r\nwere taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\r\n\r\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on\r\nthe failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe\r\nautism to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and\r\nyears of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to\r\nconverse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own\r\ncranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\r\n\r\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t\r\nwant to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few\r\nwill do good while the rest are on holiday."\r\n\r\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the\r\ndevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and\r\ncompulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\r\n\r\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away.\r\nAfter several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the\r\nhospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy.\r\nAt the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\r\n\r\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\r\n\r\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h4>\r\n\r\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side. When the family moved to Grinnell in 2001, she gave up her career to work at DJ''s side so he could attend regular school classrooms.\r\n\r\nShe taught DJ facilitated communication. The child points to pictures, symbols or letters to communicate, using a partner for support. That often involves holding a hand or touching the child as he points.\r\n\r\nThe method became controversial in the 1990s. Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\r\n\r\nExperts are unsure how it works.\r\n\r\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa-\r\nHenderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now\r\nteaches special education at the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the\r\ndiagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also\r\nremains a mystery, she said.\r\n\r\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\r\n\r\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\r\n\r\nI asked how he liked the book.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing.\r\nI asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\r\n\r\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a\r\nstraight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\r\n\r\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\r\n\r\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\r\n\r\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\r\n\r\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There\r\nare frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe\r\ninsecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at\r\nodds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which\r\ntalks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had\r\nbecome stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be\r\nreasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for\r\nreasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople.\r\ncom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown,\r\nsquealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been\r\nworking on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these\r\nvery hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his\r\nplace in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged\r\nhim to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York\r\nliterary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with\r\nautism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting\r\nhopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the\r\nanxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up\r\nbetter boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will\r\nhave to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get\r\nmad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re\r\nsmart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\r\ncan understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future.

Activist and writer Ralph James Savarese thought he and his wife, Emily, had done just that. For her it meant working with a Florida center for disabled and autistic children. For him it meant writing and teaching college students about responsibility and social obligation. But in the late ''90s they found themselves forgoing these larger causes for the smaller one staring them right in the face: an abused, autistic toddler named DJ.\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association describes autism as a disorder of impaired communication and social skills (including the delay or total lack of spoken language) and restricted or repetitive behavior such as flapping of the hands. But that view, argues Savarese in “Reasonable People: a Memoir of Autism and Adoption,” robs people with autism of their humanity and in return offers little hope. “To many experts, the non-speaking autist resembles the old version of a black hole: swallowing everything, emitting nothing; forever hidden, never to be revealed.” Are we giving up too early on those with classic autism, he asks? Or could it be that an autist’s inner world, dynamic and profoundly human, can be made accessible if society is willing to make a reasonable effort to help it bloom?\r\n\r\nThe couple is first acquainted with the blond, curly-haired DJ when he is 3 years old and foundering in foster care. Emily works with DJ, whom she meets at her center, even though he’s been written off as profoundly retarded. She also tries, and fails, to get DJ’s alcoholic mother back on her feet. When DJ is severely beaten at his foster home, a caseworker begs the Savareses to provide emergency shelter. What follows is both a real-life love story and an urgent manifesto for the rights of people with neurological differences. Savarese is honest about both his own fears and how DJ is capable of plunging even the most dedicated and high-minded adult into despair. But three years and countless bureaucratic hurdles later, the Savarese family finally extracts DJ from foster care and formally adopts him.\r\n\r\nTheir aims are lofty. First, DJ’s is an “open adoption,” meaning that visits from his older sister or other family members are encouraged. Second, Savarese and his wife are proponents of a controversial educational method called “inclusion.” With the help of on-site personal aides, they manage to include DJ in regular classrooms in Florida and then Iowa. They tirelessly urge others to open their hearts and minds to the “creative potential” of DJ’s disease, even though he might flap his arms, use his head as a battering ram and scream uncontrollably. Through the much-maligned keyboard technique of “facilitated communication,” they help DJ make his first forays into language. At first the parents do much of the typing themselves; within a few years they are offering DJ only minimal support at the wrist. He has much to share, including a heartbreaking, garbled tale of abandonment and sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nSavarese is a thorough chronicler of both DJ’s progress and the current thinking on autism. At times his writing can be overly academic, but not when it comes to detailing DJ’s life and the ease with which disabled children are often written off. In foster care DJ was denied glasses--the doctor thought he was too severely disabled for improved vision to make a difference. So he has difficulty with tasks requiring hand-eye coordination--he does puzzles entirely by touch--until his adoptive parents figured out the problem. At first the simplest word in sign language took months to perfect. Yet by the end of Savarese’s moving memoir, DJ is in sixth grade and getting all “A’s” at a regular school. “DJ’s autism remains--in all of its sometimes marvelous, sometimes aggravating, splendor,” writes Savarese. “He hasn’t been cured.”  Nor has he conquered many troubling habits, such as poking people in the eyes. But the sixth-grader writes the memoir’s last chapter himself, with only minimal assistance. There are typos and DJ’s language is often inscrutable. But his words are evidence of qualities once thought impossible for the boy: a sense of self and a concern for others. “They think well-respected, tested-as-normal kids are the OK-to-teach ones,” writes DJ. “They forget these lost kids. ”  Perhaps this book will help others remember they are more than worth the effort.', 'Newsweek', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-28 14:20:40', '2010-08-28 21:20:40', '', 185, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/185-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.\r\n\r\nEmily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.\r\n\r\nAs the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:\r\n\r\n“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”\r\n\r\nIt pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:\r\n\r\n“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,\r\n\r\n“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”\r\n\r\nAs DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”\r\n\r\nThere may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,\r\n\r\n‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”\r\n\r\nRalph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.\r\n\r\n“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”\r\n\r\nIn Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.\r\n\r\nFor all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:\r\n\r\n“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations. This is, however, a story about what life is all about: trial, error, perseverance, and faith in people. Faith in love.

The sub-title of the book is as important to culture as the title itself: “On the meaning of family and the politics of neurological difference”.  This timely book is about the Horatian life, “Life” written with a capital “L”.  Accordingly it is about family and the life of the mind; about poetry and the fierce resistance to stereotypes of people with autism.\r\n\r\nAssuredly one can think of dozens of additional sub-titles for the book: Living Outside their Boxes; Unraveling the Outworn Tapestry of Academic Autism; A Prayer Wheel by Two Poets; or The Road of Salt and Honey.   \r\n\r\nThis is a memoir about “hard traveling” as Woody Guthrie would say, and yet it is far more than a narrative of trouble and triumph.  The poet, Ralph James Savarese, skillfully tells the story of his adoptive son DJ’s former life of physical and intellectual abuse and in turn and almost seamlessly tells the story of how he and his wife Emily must grow both intellectually and emotionally and yes, politically, since DJ’s autism is the kind of disability our culture has misunderstood throughout history.   \r\n\r\nRalph James Savarese is a poet who teaches creative writing and literature at Grinnell College.  With the publication of Reasonable People he joins a group of poets who have written nonfiction accounts of disability that includes Lucy Grealy, Nancy Mairs, Mary Karr, Kenny Fries, Michael Berube, and Audre Lorde just to name a few.  Reasonable People is a landmark book, both in its poetic appreciation of what Carl Jung’s followers call “depth psychology” and for its tough minded counter-statement to a longstanding view that autistic people will, necessarily have limited epistemological options in life.  Such views are the product of neo-Victorian science and they depend on the inability of individuals to resist easy classifications.  Such resistance is, of course, the business of poetry, that “sweat of the heart” as the poet Marvin Bell would call it.\r\n\r\nThis is a book about “joint attention” as Emily, Ralph, and DJ learn to appreciate the complex interactions between the self and the other, between the moment and what lies just behind us or straight ahead.  The book is about the dark theater of autism and the academy.  It is about the flesh of belief.  Beyond this I will tell you nothing for I dislike book reviews that retell the story.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a book about poetry and parenting it is perhaps most of all DJ’s own book for it ends with his journal notes and poems.  He is now a young man who speaks for himself and who aims his own telescope at the full moon.  Again, and not wishing to give away too much, let me simply quote one of DJ’s own poems which appears near the end of the book.  It is as fine a definition of poetry and the life of the mind as I have ever seen:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>HOW BRAVE?\r\nHe was so brave that free people\r\nSaluted him every time he passed by.\r\nSo brave, if you didn''t really know him\r\nYou''d think he was a god.\r\nSo brave, the tests he took couldn''t\r\nScare him.\r\nAnd so brave, all the dreadful creatures\r\nDied.\r\nThat''s brave!</blockquote>', 'Planet of the Blind', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '181-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-28 14:20:53', '2010-08-28 21:20:53', '', 181, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/181-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Somehow the idea of having them in the house made our suspicions, and then the emerging reality, seem more intense. But the ice had to melt, and eventually I broke down and bought Greenspan''s <em>The Child With Special Needs</em>, and then <em>The Out-Of-Sync Child</em>, desperately trying to understand how our son was like the children described in those books. But he wasn''t, really, not in any clear-cut way, and the whole idea that he might be "on the spectrum" filled us with equal parts dread and confusion.\r\n\r\nThat didn''t stop me from sidling over to the children''s section in the bookstore from time to time, then furtively paging through <em>Quirky Kids</em> and <em>The Maverick Mind</em> and countless others to see if any struck a chord. But I''d always leave the store empty-handed and a little shaken. Is this really us? Am I missing something? The first memoir I read was Paul Collins'' <em>Not Even Wrong</em> (love him; reading <em>Sixpence House</em> now, which is about reading, not autism), and then Kamran Nazeer''s <em>Send in the Idiots</em>, and then one day, in an effort to find a bit of serenity, Susan Senator''s <em>Making Peace with Autism</em>. Around that time, J. and I started to ease up on the whole is-he-or-isn''t-he debate, and accept that a) if there is a spectrum, he''s on it; b) this is, in J''s words, "current events, not prophecy" and c) none of this changes who my son is: a smart, delightful, funny, loving boy.\r\n\r\nWhat were we resisting? That he was different from other children? No, that was pretty clear. That he has difficulties with speech, and motor planning, and sensory integration, and social situations? No, we got that. That we needed to give him as much therapy as we could reasonably fit into his life--and ours? No, he had a full program of therapies by the time he was two and a half. That we should limit our expectations? That he might never be independent? That he didn''t have empathy? That we should just accept all the received wisdom about what a child with autism spectrum disorder can do and will become? That our life as we knew it was over? No. No. No. No. No. We didn''t, and don''t, accept any of that. He''s given us no reason to; in fact, he''s full of surprises.\r\n\r\nSo I was delighted to find a link to Ralph Savarese''s LA Times editorial on Mom-NOS''s blog a couple of weeks ago (thanks, Mom!), in which he espouses a joyful, optimistic and, I believe, respectful model for parenting a child with special needs. I was even more delighted to read his book <em>Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption</em> this past week. Let me say this upfront: it is not a book to pick up lightly. It''s about intense commitment: commitment to a child with autism whose biological parents were unable or unwilling to care for him, who had suffered extreme neglect and abuse, who did not speak, and who, with the aid of his adoptive parents'' incredible love and persistence and ingenuity and patience, learns to communicate independently, reflect on his past, participate and excel in school and give us a glimpse--more than a glimpse--into what autism feels like from the inside.\r\n\r\nHeroic? Heartwarming? A triumph of the human spirit? I would say yes, actually, but that''s not at all what Savarese is after. Like any thoughtful memoirist, he resists the narcissism inherent in the form, and it gnaws at him throughout the book. He doesn''t want to be praised or idealized. He''s not looking for the easy out. He insists meticulously on detailing his own doubts, faults, frailties through the process of bonding with, adopting and raising his son DJ. He doesn''t shy from political, cultural, psychological, even literary analysis of autism and disability. He wants us to see it all: the anguish, the confusion, the joys, the mistakes, the odd trajectories of progress and regression.\r\n\r\nMost stunning about this book is that, through the process of facilitated communication (in which he types his thoughts with some slight physical assistance from his parents), DJ becomes able to express himself and thus tell his own story. Savarese includes many of DJ''s thoughts, poems and school assignments throughout the book, up to and including the final chapter, which is DJ''s work entirely (I did find myself wishing that his wife had had a chapter too).

The book is told memoir-style, telling the story of what it has been like thus far for Savarese and his wife, Emily, an autism inclusion expert, to raise their adopted son, DJ. However, though the main tale is that of life with DJ, Savarese uses this as a platform for the discussion of many larger societal issues that affect us all, whether we know someone with autism or not, (though clearly pretty much anyone reading this blog does.)\r\n\r\nThe first issue, or rather, the first set of issues, he talks about are those of poverty, foster care, and adoption. He discusses in detail his own initial desire to not have children, because doing so would limit his ability to take part in the wider world and would not allow him to devote his time to altruistic causes he believed in. When they first met DJ, he and his wife were devoted to getting DJ and his sister back into their biological mother''s care. Throughout the narration of their prolonged relationship with Rhonda, in which they helped her both financially and in the court system, Savarese also discusses many of the thoughts he had about the cyclic nature of poverty and his desire to see it truly confronted as a societal problem in which everyone needs to take an interest, because it is everyone''s responsibility as a whole. He continued this discussion in his description of the foster care system, in which many of the families providing foster care are poor families doing it for the childcare stipend. He notes that this draws an inadvertent, sometimes antagonistic divide, often along class lines, between prospective adoptive families and foster care families. His stark look at the foster care and state adoption systems reveal a need for change, but also a realistic look at how overtaxed the systems are, being a essentially stopgap measure for addressing much larger societal problems.\r\n\r\nOnce Savarese and his wife succeed in adopting DJ, they are determined to get him into an inclusive educational setting. Up to that point, he had attended a closed center school, in which he had made little progress. Thanks to Emily''s own inclusion expertise and both of the determination of them both to prevail over the school system, they succeeded, and DJ began on the road to literacy and learning. The arguments presented between Emily and the schools, both the center school and the public elementary school, are classic, and powerful, examples of the argument over inclusion. As one can tell from the chapter at the end of the book, though, DJ is most definitely a proponent of inclusive environments, which he makes clear in a letter addressed to his old preschool teachers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things DJ gains from his new intensive educational experiences is literacy. As it turns out, literacy opens many avenues of communication for DJ, because he says he didn''t learn to decode spoken language until he learned to read. Their efforts towards literacy also led to an inadvertent discovery of facilitated communication (FC), and Savarese spends some time defending the method in its legitimate form, discussing the controversy that surrounded it in the early ''90s, but presenting powerful evidence of research done since then proving its efficacy when used appropriately. He also mentions numerous successful users of FC, who now lead quite rich lives and are able to advocate for themselves. DJ looks well on the way to becoming one of these vocal, or should we say, typing advocates. Indeed, DJ, as well as his parents, have discovered the world of disability/identity politics, and these play a strong role in their story.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the things that makes this book so unique amongst the available books on autism, aside from its focus on adoption, is its exploration of the relationship between trauma and autism. DJ was severely physically and sexually abused by another child in foster care, and it was only after he learned to communicate that he seemed able to assimilate and understand this part of his past. This led to many problems with anxiety, anger, confusion, and separation. Dealing with this through therapy was much more complicated when combined with autism and communicating via FC, and Savarese describes many of the issues they and their therapists faced in dealing with something relatively unknown. Many of the standard therapy techniques became problems in and of themselves, as DJ began to perseverate on his past trauma, rather than moving through the memories to the other side. In addition, the more anxious and upset he became, the more violent and less communicative he would become. The combination of trauma, in this case PTSD, and autism is not a field that has been widely explored, and this book can be considered a call for more attention and research. Savarese points out that the nonverbal in our population are far more likely to suffer abuse, and this problem is probably much more widespread than we would like to think.\r\n\r\nThough Savarese also writes movingly about the meaning of family, particularly in relation to the bond between DJ and his biological sister; dealing with loss in many forms; the relationship between poetry and DJ''s unique perceptions of the world; and numerous other things, I fear that I have run on for too long already, so I''ll simply end here with a recommendation that everyone read this book. Truly, it is a moving, fascinating, and of course remarkably well-written book, and I am sad to have had to condense it this much.', 'Autism Society of North Carolina Bookstore', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '176-revision-3', '', '', '2010-09-06 15:17:21', '2010-09-06 22:17:21', '', 176, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/176-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

DJ had been abandoned by his birth father, and neglected and abused by his alcoholic birth mother. He''d been sodomized and further abused in an overcrowded fostercare home where an adolescent boy, also a victim of sexual abuse, had tried to work through his own trauma by violating the then-speechless-thus-perfect-victim, DJ,\r\n\r\nThe story retraces the Savareses'' journey through the twisted legal terrain of fostercare adoption, and into the pioneering territory of full-inclusion for DJ in a public school, in the least-restrictive educational setting, the contested terrain of facilitated communication, and the heartwrenching reunions of DJ and his birth sister — the child who had taken care of her little brother when addiction had rendered their birth mother incapable of mother-work. Through uncompromising love and commitment to DJ and his personhood, the Savareses create a home that is safe enough for DJ to reveal — in his own typed messages — the magnitude of the abuse he''d suffered in fostercare. I did skip ahead to read the last chapter, written by DJ himself, so I know that there is an amazing conclusion, if not a saccharin-laced smiley-faced happy ending.\r\n\r\nWhile there is much to love in this book and this family (pictured here), and much to discuss about it, what appeals so profoundly to me in the story is Savarese''s unwillingness to throw out the baby with the bathwater, whether that baby is his son, a commitment to inclusion and the principle of the least restrictive setting, or the emancipatory possibilities of psychoanalysis — a theory that has a well-deserved bad reputation in the autism world, saddled as it has been with the legacy of mother-blaming encapsulated in Bettelheim''s "refrigerator mother" hypothesis.\r\n\r\nI have been grappling with this very theoretical issue in my own more work, wondering what to do with psychoanalysis, and wondering what atypical language acquistion means for the development of structures like the unconscious and desire. Like Savarese, I came of age intellectually in the cultural studies milieu of the late 1980s and 90s and was steeped in a heady brew of psychoanalytic theory, dialectical materialism, and feminism.\r\n\r\nAutism parenting has challenged each of these frameworks, but none more aggressively than psychoanalytic theory. I''d backburnered my questions about this until recently, when my psychoanalytic reading group had asked me to present a paper about autism and psychoanalysis at a regional conference in February. I had agreed, and then, still conflicted about the role of psychoanalysis in autism''s misrepresentation, I was sick the weekend of the conference and wound up not going. Conflict can do that to any body.\r\n\r\nSavarese''s narrative, healing for himself and his family, has been similarly healing for me. With an easier integration of my lived experience and theoretical models, I hope to be able to present that paper this summer at a national conference — thanks to Savarese and his intellectual and emotional integrity.\r\n\r\nAnd more on Reasonable People in the days to come . . . 100 or so enveloping pages to go.', 'Autism’s Edges', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '172-revision-4', '', '', '2010-09-06 15:17:31', '2010-09-06 22:17:31', '', 172, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/172-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Writer Ralph James Savarese, the adoptive father of 12-year-old DJ, is the latest to pen a saga of what it''s like to live with autism.\r\n\r\nOne keen insight Savarese brings to the table is that autism is universally perceived with reference to average human beings as the norm. To the extent that an autist''s behavior deviates from that norm, we treat it as a disease to be cured. Within the growing autism community, however, a movement is growing to portray it as a way of life rather than as a disease to be cured.\r\n\r\nConsider my six-year-old grandson Toby, for example. He was diagnosed autistic four years ago, and intensive one-on-one therapy since then has allowed him to speak fluently, to relate to others to some degree, and to function in a mainstream first-grade classroom, albeit with the presence of aides. His perseverative behavior -- hand-flapping  and obsessively repetitive behavior, for example -- has lessened markedly. But his parents realize that Toby will likely need supportive help of some kind for the rest of his life, even though a realistic expectation is that he''ll be able to live independently as an adult.\r\n\r\nBut like many high-functioning autists, Toby exhibits strong signs of Asperger''s Syndrome -- a savant quality that enables him to run rings around kids his own age in certain specific areas. He''s long been fascinated with maps and regularly studies the schematic route maps of the MBTA system in his hometown of Boston. He can direct a driver, street by street, from his home to that of his grandparents in Hartford, something his highly talented 10 year old cousin would be at a loss to do. The point of all this is that we can learn from and value people with autism for their own impressive gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen the author adopted DJ at age 6, he was entirely non-verbal and seemed unable to communicate. Six years later, he still doesn''t speak but types fluently, aspires to become a writer, and even wrote the last chapter of the book. While parts of that chapter can be difficult to understand -- Toby edited it himself -- it provides a wonderful window into his mind. He has a profound distaste for testing, for example, and characteristic of autistic people, he seems to have made that distaste a somewhat obsessive fixation.\r\n\r\nOne highly useful construct Savarese employs is to compare DJ''s situation with that of the genius Stephen Hawking, who though non-verbal because he has Lou Gehrig''s Disease, has learned to type on a computer by moving his eyes.  So basically, Hawking and DJ started from the common condition of having something to say but needing help to get it out.

So, this issue’s focus on the corporeal (Special Double Issue: The Lyric Body) is of particular interest. Of the body, editors Stephen Kuusisto and Ralph James Savarese say they present “a form for engagement" that "is always political…and always lyrical, whether we see it that way or not.” If lyrical means poetically inspired, and political means engaged with the world, then I would say their choices for the issue are, indeed, lyrical and political. And they’re also quite wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe issue features many stars and familiar names (Adrienne Rich, Gregory Orr, Sam Hamill, Susanne Antonetta, Jennifer Finney Boylan, Ilya Kaminsky, Floyd Sloot, Mary Doty, Rafael Campo, among others) and many less familiar, though no less worthy of attention, writers (Ona Gritz, Susan Neeley, Barrie Jean Borich, Katie Ford, Jane Bernstein, among others). A number of these writers have written beautifully in other publications (including books) about related or similar matters as those in their work here (Skloot, Borich, Campo, Bernstein), but when it comes to the body, this repetition (or is it obsession?) makes a kind of lyrical and political sense. Indeed, we can never escape our embodiment.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t a poem, story, or essay I would not recommend. There are a few standouts, though: Rebecca Epstein’s “My Last-Ditch Attempt,” a manic little essay about mania; Katie Ford’s poem, “Remedies for Sorrow” (“The soldierly ready / of human sadness; it must, by nature hover”); Susanne Antonetta’s essay, “Dis,” about a struggle with lithium; an essay by Barrie Jean Borich, “APOCALYPSE, Darling.” Borich has an appealing voice and is smart storyteller. She favors family tales (her in-laws this time around), and she’s one of the few writers who make me question my firm belief that stories about one’s family don’t interest anyone except, well, one’s own family. And this poem, “The Iridescence of Life,” by Melanie Almeder, inspired by a photograph/collage of Binh Dahn, clearly both lyrical and political:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>O gray and lopsided moon, above your face, the wings,\r\nthis room – moon that shone on the gutted heaps\r\nof the Khmer Rouge’s labor – if there’s grace left –please,\r\nlet there be grace left – then let it utter its syllables here,\r\nand unhinge the dear wing of your face.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFinally, more overtly political in theme than many of the works in the issue, and less overtly lyrical in language, but sublimely lyrical in intention, is Amitava Kumar’s diary/essay, “Tortured Body" which are "entries from a teacher''s diary kept during Bush’s war on terror.” If every student had a teacher like Kumar there would certainly be considerably more lyricism and less terror.\r\n', 'Review of "The Lyric Body"', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '88-revision-3', '', '', '2010-08-29 13:17:30', '2010-08-29 20:17:30', '', 88, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/88-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

For this non-speaking boy with autism, abandoned at the age of three and literally tortured in foster care, anxiety remains his biggest challenge.\r\n\r\n"Your breathing would make me nervous," he wrote to his teachers at the special school he attended before we adopted him. "Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write?" he remonstrated them. "I very much value teachers who give nice instructions breathing easily."\r\n\r\nIn contrast, he extolled his time in a regular classroom: "Easy, quiet breathing waits to hear my words, and respect grows. Awesome, caring teachers read my writing and reward me by writing back." It''s as if DJ, a sixth-grader, had transformed the primary, physical symptom of his anxiety -- heavy breathing -- into a political concept.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the amelioration of anxiety has been inexorably tied to the experience of inclusion: of being wanted by family, school, and community. "Breathing feels great now," he declared on his talking computer during an especially good stretch in the sixth grade. "Breathing feels kind of like joy. When I''m breathing easily, I''m sort of like respected kids."\r\n\r\nHow can respected adults breathe easily about autism? For one thing, we can promote inclusion as an opportunity to get to know autistic individuals. Such interaction would help to debunk the idea of a catastrophic disorder that precludes awareness of self and others. For too long scientists have terrorized us with this claim.\r\n\r\nFor another, we can devote more research money to improving the quality of life for people with autism. For every two studies on the cause, or causes, of autism, there ought to be at least one on the goal of autistic self-fulfillment. With richly rewarding lives as the norm, non-autistics might be less hysterical about finding a cure.\r\n\r\nDon''t get me wrong: autism presents significant, sometimes monumental, challenges. DJ, for example, is unable to speak, has sensory processing difficulties, and engages in repetitive behavior.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the boy who was labeled profoundly retarded when he came to live with us at the age of six is now a straight "A" student in a regular school, testing off the charts and using a computer to communicate. He''s also the most empathetic and politically conscious young person I know.\r\n\r\nI''m convinced that we can move forward with a vigorous research agenda while respecting the person with autism. But we have to make room for this difference in the world. We have to reduce the stigma attached to it. At the same time, we have to provide more support for parents who frequently find themselves at the ends of their ropes.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, DJ was asked to compose a paragraph about the American flag for an Elks Club writing contest. His paragraph went like this: "The great United States of America is breathtakingly not free. Equality is not sacred because not everyone has access to it. Free people treat my people, very smart people who type to communicate, as mindless.... The creators of everyone''s very important Declaration of Independence wasted their breath."\r\n\r\nHere was a boy demanding his place in America. I took note of the signature metaphor and pictured democracy itself in respiratory distress.\r\n\r\nRecently, DJ was much more sanguine -- and serene -- in an essay comparing the plight of his "people" with that of African Americans; he''d just studied the civil rights movement. "I imagine my words resembling dead Martin Luther King''s respectful vision," he typed.\r\n\r\nMight we neurotypicals mirror such equanimity when confronting the challenges of autism?\r\n\r\nRalph James Savarese is the author, with his son, of Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption (Other Press 2007).

It was a reasonable question in this age of narrow self-concern — far more reasonable, or at least more reasonably put, than many of the other questions we fielded.\r\n\r\nFor example, "Why don''t you have your own children?" a wealthy relative inquired, as if natural family-making were a kind of gated community it was best never to abandon. "You two have such good genes," she added. "Why waste them?"\r\n\r\nA colleague at work confronted me in the mailroom with this memorable gem: "Have you tried in-vitro?" She feared that we hadn''t availed ourselves of the many wondrous technologies that rescue infertile couples. "Wouldn''t that be better than adopting a child with a disability?" she asked, drawing out the word "disability." "God knows what that kid''s parents were doing when they conceived him."\r\n\r\n"We''re not infertile," I barked. "We have a relationship with the boy."\r\n\r\nMy wife, an autism expert, had offered his mother services, but as the woman found it increasingly difficult to care for her son and then dropped out of the picture altogether, we''d started spending time with him. His first communicative act with language, at age 3 — the sign for "more" — we''d taught him while tickling his belly.\r\n\r\nHe later made that sign in the emergency room of a hospital where he was brought after being beaten in foster care. Upon seeing us — we''d been called in to try to calm him — he stopped in his tracks, paused (as if to allow some associative chain to complete itself) and demanded obsessively to be tickled. I remember searching on his chest for unbruised patches among the purple, blue and black. He was that frantic in his quest for the familiar and, dare I say, for love.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I can''t believe how callous people were; the strange anxiety that adopting a child with a disability provoked. And the anxiety just kept coming. "Healthy white infants must be tough to get," a neighbor commented. No paragons of racial sensitivity, we were nevertheless appalled by the idea that we''d do anything to avoid adopting, say, a black child or a Latino one.\r\n\r\nAs offensive was the assumption that we must be devout Christians: hyperbolic, designated do-gooders with a joint eye firmly on some final prize. "God''s reserving a special place for you," we heard on more than one occasion, as if our son deserved pity and we were allowed neither our flaws nor a different understanding of social commitment. The journalist Adam Pertman, in his otherwise excellent book, "Adoption Nation," reproduces this logic exactly when he speaks of "children so challenging that only the most saintly among us would think [my italics] of tackling their behavioral and physical problems."\r\n\r\nDespite the stigma attached to "special-needs children," people do adopt these kids. And yet, many more Americans spend gobs of money on fertility treatments or travel to foreign countries to find their perfect little bundles. I''m haunted by something my son wrote after we taught him how to read and type on a computer: "I want you to be proud of me. I dream of that because in foster care I had no one." How many kids lie in bed at night and think something similar?\r\n\r\nThe physical and behavioral problems have been significant, at times even crushing. The last eight years have been devoted almost exclusively to my son''s welfare: literacy training, occupational therapy, relationship building, counseling for post-traumatic stress — the list goes on and on. But what strides he has made.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was still in diapers and said to be retarded when he came to live with us is now a straight-A student at our local middle school. He''s literally rewriting the common scripts of autism and "attachment disorder" (the broad diagnosis for the problems of abandoned and traumatized kids). These are hopeless scripts, unforgiving scripts in which the child can''t give back.\r\n\r\nMy son does, and others can as well. Recently, in response to my hip replacement, he typed on his computer, "I''m nervous because Dad has not brought me braces [his word for crutches]." I was just home from the hospital — wobbly, a bit depressed, in pain. To my question, "Why do you need crutches?" he responded endearingly, "You know how I like to be just like you."

As Savarese states, "This is not a Disney story." The book''s first fifteen chapters — gripping reading — delineate how Ralph and his wife, Emily, adopted DJ, a boy with autism, at a young age. He was a ''low-functioning,'' non-verbal child of an alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned him. Painfully separated from a loving sibling, DJ had been placed, or rather misplaced, by Florida''s Department of Children and Families in a wildly inappropriate foster-care setting where his guardians knew nothing about autism and where he wound up being so badly beaten he had to be hospitalized.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the book depicts the years of difficult emotional struggle with the birth family and Ralph and Emily''s efforts to help DJ recover from the trauma of abuse. The remaining two thirds are devoted to how they taught him to communicate. Ralph and Emily spent three or four years with him in painstaking literacy preparation, using primarily photographs and other stimuli (not phonics) to inculcate the concept of representation. Body therapy, occupational therapy, and various other modalities also contributed to the development of literacy. <em>Reasonable People</em> extends to its considerable length precisely because it lays out in detail how DJ broke the code of reading. When they had first adopted him, he had been unresponsive to spoken language, but once he could read, he found such language discernible.\r\n\r\nReading this book, one is reminded of the early nineteenth-century account by the Frenchman Jean Mark Gaspard Itard of his unsuccessful attempt to teach language to the ''feral'' boy found in the woods near Aveyron. What Itard did not have was access to technology. At around the age of nine, DJ was introduced to Facilitated Communication (FC). Entailing a laptop with amplified memory and voice software, FC can, given much effort and certain conditions, allow a nonverbal autist to speak. Initially, the FC technology was greeted with euphoria because of its possibilities to release a class of people perceived to be nonverbal into communication. People jumped to the conclusion that every person with autism was ready to communicate through FC. However, the exaggerated claims were discredited in the 1990s and a reaction set in: in the view of professionals, FC became associated with desperate parents'' ''wishful thinking.''\r\n\r\nSavarese passionately counters FC''s detractors, and with good reason, for the record of DJ''s progress stands as testimony to the fact that his son has used FC effectively. DJ is fully mainstreamed in the ninth grade (he is 14 or 15 now) of a Grinnell public school, and last year he was a straight-A student. Savarese questions many of the culturally fabricated assumptions concerning autism. He forcefully calls for a paradigm shift in the way medical professionals, psychologists, educators, parents of autistic children, and the public at large conceive of the condition. Specifically, he envisions reevaluating the notions of a ''low functioning,'' incompetent autist at one end of the spectrum and of a romanticized, high level Asperger''s type at the other, suggesting that in lieu of these, people should consider "what is possible." If his and Emily''s vision sounds optimistic, even utopian, it also is rooted in experience and the evidence of DJ''s\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that some will view <em>Reasonable People</em> as strident: while he was assembling the manuscript, a publisher offered to pay a significant advance if only he would tone down the rhetoric — make the memoir less political — and transform it into a heartwarming, inspirational tale about disability being a matter of isolated, individual struggle leading to eventual triumph. To his great credit, he refused the offer and instead completed the book he set out to write, namely, one addressing the public''s role in disability and society''s responsibilities to all of its citizens.\r\n\r\nIntelligently engaging narratives by parents of disabled children (such as this one) have been few, for such dramatic personal stories charged with wrenching emotion too often sink into self-absorbed pathos. Still, exceptions do exist, and one looks for comparisons. (For a comprehensive discussion of the "parental memoir," see Mark Osteen''s "Autism and Representation: A Comprehensive Introduction" in <em>Autism and Representation</em>, ed. Mark Osteen, New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 1- 47.)Both literate and witty is Martha Beck''s 1999 <em>Expecting Adam</em>, a story about raising a child with Down Syndrome in a Harvard milieu. And there is the 1996 <em>Life As We Know It</em> by Michael Bérubé, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State and a parent of a child with Down Syndrome. Bérubé discusses not only what life is like with his son Jamie but also genetics, abortion, social Darwinism, right-wing politics, St. Augustine, Descartes, Freud, and Foucault. Life As We Know It is one of the few instances of the genre to include an index. Savarese did not include one, though he doesuse endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe most fitting text with which to compare <em>Reasonable People</em> would the 1995<em>A Healing Family</em> by Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel Prize winning Japanese novelist and father of a child with a learning disability. This is not to say that the two match exactly. They definitely differ in heft: the finely crafted <em>Healing Family</em>, totaling 146 pages, can be read in a single sitting while <em>Reasonable People</em>, a 460-page tome, occupies the bedside table for at least a week. Duration aside, the resemblance between them can be traced, first, to the deep commitment each exhibits with regard to championing human rights and especially the right of people with mental disabilities to full social inclusion. And second, each refuses to conduct a monologue, for both open a space for the children to participate. Participating does not mean that their fathers merely quote them; instead, the sons of Oe and Savarese fill their own pages. Oe''s son, Hikari, was born in 1963 with a herniated brain; Oe was told that his son might never be more than a\r\n"human vegetable," and for many years he needed almost constant care. Even so, Hikari developed talents in music and art, and <em>A Healing Family</em> not only describes how he acquired these abilities but also includes color reproductions of ten of his drawings.\r\n\r\nThat Hikari holds forth on his own is hardly inconsequential, for, in light of the conventions and limitations of the parental memoir and the history of and assumptions associated with non-verbal intellectual disability, the question of who speaks presses urgently. Since the eighteenth century, the criteria for human species membership have been determined in great part by mental capacity and especially linguistic capability. Whether those in whom linguistic capability is compromised will be accorded a full set of human rights surfaces as the foremost question whenever non-verbal cognitive impairment comes under scrutiny. Indirectly addressing the issue is Gayatri Spivak''s 1988 essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in which she investigates whether the historically marginalized, colonized people truly are empowered to speak. For Spivak, the subaltern must be able to voice challenges to mistaken assumptions. Especially in the last thirty years, people with physical disabilities at least have spoken up for themselves through disability autobiography. G. Thomas Couser describes this genre as "an anti-colonial phenomenon, a form of autoethnography, as Mary Louise Pratt has defined it: ''instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in way that engage with [read: contest] the colonizer''s own terms.''" If people with physical disabilities can represent themselves and ''talk back'' to the hegemonic ablist culture through autobiography, how is a non-verbal person with a mental disability to do the same? In the grown-up-driven genre of the parental memoir, the adult speaks for the child. Consequently, with regard to these memoirs, a central concern for a reader coming from a disability rights perspective will be the degree of contact afforded between reader and child by the mediating parent-author.\r\n\r\nSavarese follows Oe''s lead by opening a space for DJ to present himself to the reader: the young man contributes the sixteenth and final chapter entitled "It''s My Story!" The memoir''s first fifteen chapters really serve as prologue, explaining how DJ''s chapter came to be written. It is from this section in fact that the title Reasonable People derives; DJ writes, "I''m reasonable. Polite people make me feel comfortable. Which by the way isn''t very often. Reasonable people promote very very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me." Of the way he should be treated, he states, "People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind." Of the self-esteem beginning to shape up within him, he proclaims that "Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, kind, mighty, very smart self." In another passage he associates himself with the civil rights movement, and in another he contests the culturally fabricated assumptions of the neurotypical majority about people like him. At one point he even ''talks back'' to his former teachers in Florida, criticizing them sharply with regard to the education he received: "[Y]ears of easy lessons were wasted. Why weren''t you teaching me to talk, to read and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start could have begun sooner."\r\n\r\nWhat G. Thomas Couser observes of such texts as the 1994 <em>Count Us In:Growing Up with Down Syndrome</em> by Jason Kingsley and Mitchell Levitz could be extended to DJ''s chapter: "the very existence of first-person narratives makes its own point: that people with condition ''X'' are capable of self-representation. The autobiographical act models the agency and self-determination that the disability rights movement has fought for." Like Spivak''s subaltern, the purportedly nonverbal person with an intellectual disability not only can but will speak. In at least four ways this book makes a significant contribution to the national conversation on autism and to Disability Studies. First, "It''s My Story!" can be excerpted and read as a freestanding essay, perhaps in some future anthology of writing by people with learning disabilities. But even if such an anthology never materializes, this powerful piece of first-person exposition should find its way onto the reading lists of university-level Education and Cultural Disability Studies courses. It may be appropriate high school reading as well. Second, the book in its entirety can educate parents, teachers, and psychologists, encouraging them to experiment with Emily and Ralph''s techniques that worked so well with DJ. Third, it will reawaken interest in FC, by means of which DJ has been empowered to contest his supposedly ''non-verbal'' status. And fourth, those who read it will be forced to think twice about the various conventional wisdoms associated with autism, to expand their thinking, and in the end, hopefully, to reconsider "what is possible."', 'Disability Studies Quarterly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '189-revision-5', '', '', '2010-09-20 12:56:09', '2010-09-20 19:56:09', '', 189, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/189-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ralph, who is an English Professor at Grinnell College in Iowa writes about his family’s arduous journey to adopting DJ who has been separated from his “neurotypical” sister, Ellie. Their biological mother, Rhonda, a substance abuser, is in and out of their lives and later creates obstacles in the process of adoption. During Rhonda’s absences, Ellie was left to assume care of DJ until she was taken to move in with her biological father. The father, who is self-described as “an unemployed former drug user,” marries an HIV positive woman who takes in Ellie, in order to rebuild a “normal” life – a life without DJ. DJ, in turn, is subjugated to the perilous world of foster care. The split between biological siblings is the constant source of pain for both throughout,and we view it through DJ’s transcripts and Ralph’s re-telling of events.\r\n\r\nEmily, Ralph’s wife, is an expert on inclusion and had been working with DJ. One evening she brings DJ their home. In a charming early encounter, we watch as Ralph falls in love with DJ when they lock foreheads and stare at each other — this is their first “connection.” Soon after, Ralph begins to engage DJ in a tickle game which becomes their early pathway to life and love together.\r\n\r\nAs the story opens, Ralph foreshadows the stress to come by illustrating the brief reunion of DJ and his biological sister, Ellie, and how the shadow of sorrow follows their temporal happiness:\r\n\r\n“With great difficulty Ellie pulled DJ uphill. At six, her birth brother, whom she hadn’t seen in nearly three years, understood rollerblading to be a matter exclusively of somebody else’s exertion. While you labored, he’d stand with his legs a bit too close together, his chest a bit too rigidly upright, his eyes more than a bit too captivated by whatever birds were darting overheard or leaves were rustling in the wind….With amazement, we watched the girl effortlessly reassume the role of facilitator as she directed DJ around the park….Even more significant, she refused to be saddened by what her brother couldn’t give her after their long separation – what he couldn’t say or do. But then he had given her something. In fact he’d stunned her, stunned all of us, when just before we were to meet in the city, he’d spotted his sister a full block away, run up to her, and like a character in a French movie, placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks…The girl seemed to ride the gesture right into the afternoon, as if it were pulling her.”\r\n\r\nIt pulls us too. We can’t help but root for the reconnection of DJ and Ellie throughout the book. The anguish that DJ experiences as a result of separation is increasingly evident as he begins to acquire language through Facilitated Communication which Ralph notes, “I’m with Margaret Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard who appears in Autism Is A World and who is quoted in the Washington Post article as saying that FC was “oversold in the beginning” and then, like the proverbial baby, “thrown out with the bathwater.” Ralph shows the belabored task of teaching literacy to DJ and it how it opened up a whole new world of psychological stress and awakening. “Language meant anxiety,” said Ralph:\r\n\r\n“Language meant fear….Put provocatively, language is the group home of life. By the time an infant recognizes his separation from his mother and can speak of her as a discrete object, he is already racing toward the lonely singularity of adulthood.” And,\r\n\r\n“Ellie became the name he’d track like a bounty hunter through the swamps of longing…”\r\n\r\nAs DJ’s literacy unfolds, we begin to witness increased aggression and violence at home and at school, and we learn more of his own abuse in foster care. Ralph refers to DJ’s mind in these references to abuse like a “Mission Impossible communiqué, combusting immediately after it’s read.”\r\n\r\nSavarese’s parlance about DJ, and the recapturing of a traumatic past through FC, continues to suggest that we need to look longer and harder at cognitive disability and all disabilities. The violence and aggression, alongside Emily and Ralph’s perseverance to help DJ – through the post-traumatic-stress, through trials of medications, through the rocky road of mainstream schools and inclusion (even though inclusion worked to DJ’s and his classmate’s benefit because of the Savarese’s) – all communicate the challenge of autistic behaviors while suggesting that we must always consider that there is more to our autistic children than meets the eye; that autism does not render a person unaware. In fact, we sense where this autism journey might take us early on when Ralph states in reference to raising DJ, “To us there was no such thing as unbridgeably distant.”\r\n\r\nThere may be no such thing as a bridge that can’t be crossed but Ralph illustrates there are many broken bridges. His radar for prejudice is acutely sensitive throughout the book, and this is illustrated in the way the public viewed DJ’s behaviors on an airplane, to schools, and sadly, to a visitation with Ellie and the biological father when the latter says,\r\n\r\n‘Does he take their tests.? What’s the point of this inclusion stuff, to make the parents feel better about having a retard for a son?’ The man actually used the word ‘retard.’ I don’t’ know if he’d discerned that he was in trouble with his daughter, had exaggerated DJ’s disability, or whether he suddenly felt that he was in trouble with himself….I don’t know if he was merely like so many other people who know nothing about disability and advance a case of prejudice.”\r\n\r\nRalph succeeds by making DJ not only the main character, but gives him his own voice by relaying their computer “conversations” to us, which are recorded meticulously.\r\n\r\n“Part of what we were doing was compensating for the autism, but mostly for DJ’s belated emergence. In fact, DJ would end up becoming a great professor of feeling, understanding in its innumerable cultural inflections – all of this a rejoinder to the autism experts and their ‘devastating’ theories.”\r\n\r\nIn Ralph’s book, we bear witness to this difficult process of adoption, autism, stress, epilepsy, trauma and the struggle to connect and create a family against many odds. One can’t stop thinking of the challenges that adoptive parents take on willingly while others may complain endlessly about the plight of their family because of autism. But Ralph will have none of that. While there is pain, there is never talk of a cure, or of wanting DJ to be anyone other than who he is, except to alleviate the struggle. Like most parents, Emily and Ralph want to help DJ with communication, and to have him happy or at least content despite a life of loss, to hopefully replace it with a life of gain.\r\n\r\nFor all of his autistic behaviors and inability to talk, DJ is bathed in Ralph and Emily’s considerate light, where all of his actions are interpreted as real communication and thus DJ is returned from a level of subterranean species back to humanity: “Only her goodbyes would provoke the emotional scurrying of a frightened animal or the hiding-in-plain-light routine we’d come to think of as the mind in brilliant camouflage.” Here, Ralph makes reference to DJ’s encounter with his biological mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ralph is predisposed to taking care of DJ: “Can one be too serious? Can one still live, as Thoreau once put it, ‘deliberately?’” With all of his self-deprecation and reflection throughout the book, I am convinced that Ralph and Emily’s act to adopt DJ was not to be benevolent for the sake of it, or to bestow pity on DJ, although they truly had strong feelings for what he had been through. It is their persistence and work with DJ that carries the narrative. There is a sense of what’s right and wrong, and justice due to DJ. There is so much pain throughout, and despite all, the triumph is one not only of will, it is one where we watch a child, otherwise lost and forgotten in the world of foster-care, now remembered, celebrated and succeeding as an autistic individual — and respected no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was left for DJ to write. As a parent of an autistic child, its message struck me as serious, considering the lessons we are learning about autism, and how autistic people best learn:\r\n\r\n“Dad has written a book about my fresh start. I’ve written the last chapter. Please read it because in it I write about how years of early lessons were wasted. Why weren’t you teaching me to talk, to read, and to write? All you had to do was awesomely encourage me as smart and really kind, and fresh start really could have begun sooner. Your breathing would make me nervous. People weren’t assuring me as sweet, inspiring me to work at dreaming of typing to responsibility act like everyone deserving respect…Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up boy’s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing….Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who can really understand.”\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a story with a proverbial happy ending which some people come to expect: a miracle cure for autism as it were, or DJ’s journey to “normalcy.” Sadly, DJ and many others like him, will continue to be subject to discrimination, and the anxiety may never really be over. As a daughter of an adopted child, I am also more than aware of the painful, incomplete legacy that lives on inside the adopted one, and how that can even carry on in continuing generations.

He began talking nonstop about his journey with DJ, the greatest experience of his life. \n\n<h3>Progress chronicled, but anger, too.</h3>\n\nAt its simplest, the story is of a boy raised by an abusive mother whose five children were taken by the state of Florida. Savarese''s wife, Emily, worked with disabled children, including DJ. The couple didn''t have children and immediately bonded with him.\n\nTheir quest to adopt DJ fills nearly the first third of the book, between commentary on the failed foster care system, philosophical arguments over personal and social responsibility, and examination of the controversy over the ability of a child with severe autism to communicate.\n\nIn the last two-thirds of the book we see DJ come to life after painstaking months and years of learning words through pictures, then using facilitated communication to converse by pointing to words and letters on a keyboard.\n\nIt was painful and challenging. Savarese doesn''t sugarcoat anything, including his own cranky thoughts.  He rails against his own rich father for his failings, his sister for her self-centered ways, society for its cruelty to the disabled and even himself for the anger toward those who had done the young boy wrong.\n\n"The editor asked me to be more sentimental in the book," Savarese said. "But I didn''t want to be the designated do-gooder. I''m not that good. It''s too easy to then say a few will do good while the rest are on holiday."\n\nDJ was literally thrown away by society, like many with autism. Those with the developmental disorder characterized by difficulty with language, emotions and compulsiveness were labeled a "black hole," with little understanding of what goes in and an inability to let anything out.\n\nIn DJ, the Savareses saw a life in the balance, another kid who would be tossed away. After several visits to the DJ who was in foster care, the Savareses got a call from the hospital. DJ had been beaten by another foster child in the home, a 13-year-old boy. At the hospital, DJ made a hand sign to Savarese, one he had learned in prior visits, that meant "more, more." He was pleading for tickling.\n\nSavarese had to search for a spot without bruises.\n\n"How could we walk away from that?" he said.\n\n<h3>Symbols, a partner aid communication</h3>\n\nDJ enters the room wearing his backpack, his mother at his side.

Some research surmised it was a hoax - that the partner was guiding the child''s hand to letters.  Savarese said that more in-depth research in the last few years has proved the method is authentic. Some with autism are even independently typing now in college.\n\nExperts are unsure how it works.\n\n"It doesn''t make sense to you and me, but touch helps them focus," said Christi Kasa- Henderickson, who worked with DJ while at the University of Northern Iowa. She now teaches special education at the University of Colorado.\n\nMore people are using facilitated communication today at the same time that the diagnosis of autism is at an all-time high - 1 in 150 children, an increase that also remains a mystery, she said.\n\nThe publisher sent a representative to Iowa to check on the authenticity of DJ''s communication.\n\n"I understand," Savarese said. "We live in a culture of hoaxes."\n\nDJ was no hoax. He sat at his mother''s side on the sofa. She gripped one end of a pencil and DJ held the other and began to answer questions.\n\nI asked how he liked the book.\n\n"Yes. Plotting to write my own book," he said, a computer voice transmitting his typing. I asked what he would write about. "Young kids deserve a regular education."\n\nHe was saying that kids with autism should learn alongside the "neurotypical." He is a straight-A student now in a regular ninth-grade classroom. His method of communication has allowed others to see an autistic mind at work.\n\n"Yes, I kill my autism by typing," DJ said.\n\nBetween typing, DJ obsessively touched my pen as I wrote, before his parents called him back to task. He squealed and rose to pace the room, flapping his arms, before gently being told to focus.\n\nThen he typed: "My mean self is here."\n\n<h4>From dissecting past to looking forward</h4>\n\nThe task of teaching language to a child with autism is difficult, to say the least. There are frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\n\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe insecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\n\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at odds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\n\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which talks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had become stuck in his own hurt.\n\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic expressions.\n\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\n\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\n\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with her.\n\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be reasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for reasonable behavior toward those who are different.\n\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\n\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\n\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople. com.\n\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\n\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\n\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\n\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown, squealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\n\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been working on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\n\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these very hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his place in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\n\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\n\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged him to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\n\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York literary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with autism.\n\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting hopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\n\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\n\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\n\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the anxiety caused by differences in people.\n\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\n\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\n\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up better boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will have to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get mad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re smart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\ncan understand."\n\nAnd then he concludes:\n\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future.

There\r\nare frequent outbursts from anxiety. The Savarese family called it "poking," and at times it was violent.\r\n\r\nAs DJ came to language, he also was faced with communicating his past. He was sexually abused in foster care by an older foster child. He suffered severe\r\ninsecurity about losing his adoptive parents.\r\n\r\nAt points in the book, the pressure is almost unbearable. Savarese and his wife are at\r\nodds, and DJ encounters anxious moments by wildly thrashing at his parents.\r\n\r\nThe parents wrestled with approaches, moving from traditional psychotherapy, which\r\ntalks out the past trauma, to urging DJ to be positive and forward-looking. He had\r\nbecome stuck in his own hurt.\r\n\r\nBut they also saw a young man develop with a keen sensitivity to others and poetic\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nWhen Savarese''s young nephew dies of cancer, DJ faces his grieving aunt by going to his typing machine immediately.\r\n\r\n"Do you have reasonable people to help you with your hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis aunt still has the slip of paper emitted from the typing machine and carries it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSavarese used the word to snap his son out of his compulsive behaviors - "Be\r\nreasonable." But it also took on larger meanings, a political urging to society for\r\nreasonable behavior toward those who are different.\r\n\r\nDJ wants to help other kids now, as a "political freedom fighter," while waging his private battles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, hoping to get free of anxiety but not there yet," he said.\r\n\r\nHe is asked again about his writing, his poetry on the Web site www.reasonablepeople.\r\ncom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love to get free of the terrifying anxiety. Hear real self," he said.\r\n\r\n<h4>Using language to erase anxiety</h4>\r\n\r\nSavarese constructed a large building in his backyard to hold an indoor trampoline. Jumping with others has become the physical play that connects DJ to his parents and to friends.\r\n\r\nHe jumps high and around the trampoline with his father. Then he has a meltdown,\r\nsquealing loudly. Savarese pins him down.\r\n\r\n"You''ve got to be positive," he tells him gently. "You can do it. This is what we''ve been\r\nworking on. You''ve got to deal with nervousness in a positive way."\r\n\r\nDJ''s anxiety has many colors. He was anxious about the book, saying he resents "these\r\nvery hurtful conversations being easy reading for everyone." He is anxious about his\r\nplace in the world, growing older and struggling with independence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he loves about his parents, he says: "Yes, treated with respect for first time in my life. Yes, lose them and I lose everything."\r\n\r\nHis parents assure him that they will always be there for him. They have encouraged\r\nhim to type independently, and Savarese even saw him doing it once.\r\n\r\nThey constantly encourage him to use his gifts. He has already signed with a New York\r\nliterary agent. He wants to change the world''s view of the capabilities of people with\r\nautism.\r\n\r\n"I hesitate," DJ says. "Frees (a word for "neurotypical") don''t hear much of my plotting\r\nhopeful responsible respectful thoughts."\r\n\r\nBut after his successful inclusion in the Grinnell schools, buoyed by students eager to be his friend and helpful teachers'' aides and the nationwide publicity he has received from this book, the "frees" now hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe is a boy who can''t talk but communicates like few do.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be nervous. Savarese wrote that language can help erase the\r\nanxiety caused by differences in people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Language unlocked his son.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe last words in the book are DJ''s, a letter to teachers at a specialized school in Florida before he was adopted, before he came to life.\r\n\r\n"Quite pleased that you are respecting and reading this tested-as-smart, growing up\r\nbetter boy''s resentment. I live in constant fear that respect will be taken away, and I will\r\nhave to return to easy years of doing nothing.... Fear wakes easy lessons, and I get\r\nmad. I want you to know that easy effort estimates kids as retarded when they''re\r\nsmart.... Reasonable people should each see what they can do to free people who really\r\ncan understand."\r\n\r\nAnd then he concludes:\r\n\r\n"Until I freed myself through writing, people thought I had no mind. Freeing kids who are estimated as retarded is my hope for the future. Years of fresh start have begun!\r\n\r\nYour respectful student,\r\nDJ Savarese"', 'Des Moines Register', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '187-revision-7', '', '', '2010-09-20 21:10:42', '2010-09-21 04:10:42', '', 187, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/187-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Adapting George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s notion of “philosophy in the flesh”—the fact that cognition is embodied, which is to say radically conditioned by physiological systems—it analyzes the nonfiction work of Tito Mukhopadhyay, an Indian writer in America whom the medical community would describe as “severely” autistic. The article contends that Mukhopadhyay’s alternative embodiment gives rise to both a different sense of relation and a different way with words, each in some respects preferable to the neurotypical standard. Paying attention to Mukhopadhyay’s body challenges— with proprioception, sensory processing, over- and under-inclusion of details in his apprehension of the environment, word finding, a drive to associate, a persistent animism, and synesthesia— it suggests that he is a cross-cultural, cross-sensorial migrant: a neuro-cosmopolitan armed with metaphor in a world that is often quite hostile to the neurological other. Finally, it situates Mukhopadhyay’s writing squarely in the burgeoning neurodiversity movement, which, though recognizing the difficulties that autism often presents, nonetheless asks that it be treated and accommodated as difference.\r\n\r\nRead <a href="http://www.ralphsavarese.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PostColonialNeurologyPDFsavarese.pdf">Toward a Postcolonial Neurology (PDF)</a>.', 'Toward a Postcolonial Neurology: Autism, Tito Mukhopadhyay, and a New Geo-poetics of the Body', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '854-revision-3', '', '', '2011-08-07 18:37:44', '2011-08-08 01:37:44', '', 854, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/854-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Why not the first nonspeaking person with autism to live in the dorms? Inspired by those who have broken barriers before him, DJ is driven to do the same for those who come after.

He needs to acclimate himself to very different surroundings; he needs to hire a team that will support him in and out of the classroom; he needs to familiarize college personnel with his particular neurological difference and the accommodations it requires; and, as he typed on his iPad, he "needs to find dear, reasonable people who will help allay [his] fear." The labor and expense will be prodigious—think NASA preparing for the first man on the moon—but my son deserves a shot at his dream, having worked harder at his studies than any young person I know. Thankfully, Oberlin has said that it is committed to learning how to facilitate his success.

First- and second-year students can live in a dorm that is, or is not, substance-free (the term that colleges use to designate spaces where neither drugs nor alcohol can be consumed) or in a student-run co-operative house. Singles, doubles, triples and some quads are available. A few rooms even come with their own bathroom. Students can eat in either one of the two cafeterias, or they can be a dining member of a student-run co-op. Third- and fourth-year students have even more options. When I asked DJ what his preferences were, he typed the following:\r\n\r\nI want to live where I feel safe and free to be myself without the stress of having to act normal. Home is safe because my mom and dad make me feel hopeful that changing people''s attitudes toward nonspeaking autists is possible. As I go to college, I am hoping to create a really supportive community of fresh-thinking people who view me as caring and created as equal. I dread confronting people who misunderstand me or who underestimate autists. Dread creates fear. Resting in my quiet room helps me desert fear. I feel like a single room is necessary, so I have a loving space where I can reassess myself as the smart, respectable person I am. Right now I am leaning toward living in the substance-free dorm. I know from experience that drugs and drinking create dangerous situations in which even friends can become untrustworthy. Cafeterias are fearful because they serve food that really feels dreadful in my breathing easy body. At Oberlin, students can eat in student run co-ops where the food is healthier. I hope to join a co-op that offers fresh fruit and meat. Treating me as free to make my own decisions feels fearful but hopeful. In my mind, Oberlin College''s golden buildings represent hope, and hope breaks barriers.\r\n\r\nAs his father, I want DJ to understand that even if it doesn’t work out, he is a success. It may be that this sort of pioneering demands too much of a nonspeaking person with autism. Perhaps he will decide to live off-campus or even leave for a college closer to home. Perhaps Oberlin just won’t be ready for this kind of experience yet; despite wanting in the abstract to be inclusive, much more preparatory work on its end might need to be done. Who knows? Nothing about our journey as a family has been certain. At each step, there have been seemingly insurmountable obstacles: getting DJ out of foster care, including him in a regular school, teaching him how to read and to type, helping him to transition to middle school and then to high school, getting him ready to take the ACTs and to apply to colleges.

As I go to college, I am hoping to create a really supportive community of fresh-thinking people who view me as caring and created as equal. I dread confronting people who misunderstand me or who underestimate autists. Dread creates fear. Resting in my quiet room helps me desert fear. I feel like a single room is necessary, so I have a loving space where I can reassess myself as the smart, respectable person I am. Right now I am leaning toward living in the substance-free dorm. I know from experience that drugs and drinking create dangerous situations in which even friends can become untrustworthy. Cafeterias are fearful because they serve food that really feels dreadful in my breathing easy body. At Oberlin, students can eat in student run co-ops where the food is healthier.

As he notes in another commentary, [3] part of which serves as the essay’s first epigraph, verisimilitude doesn’t interest him; rather, he paints to his senses, and the  senses in autism are often especially charged. With tremendous wit he links the “vivider dayglo colors” of the painting’s skies with the birds’ freedom to soar as they wish.

But as my adopted son became literate, my plan for the book changed. I knew that I wanted to include his words in the book and even end the project with a chapter written by him. In this way, the book would embody the movement from advocacy to self-advocacy, representation to self-representation. Ultimately, my hope is that people will re-think the classical Autist—whom Oliver Sacks once described, very disparagingly, as “the creature for whom very little future lies in store.” My son, who once carried a label of profound mental retardation, is now a fully included, honor roll student at our local middle school; he most certainly does have a future, and others with classical autism do as well.\r\n\r\nRead more of <a href="http://www.nlmfoundation.org/about_autism/features/savarese_features.htm">"An Interview with Ralph J.

Savarese\r\n\r\nHumanities Writ Large Fellow, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA\r\n\r\nThis triad of clinicians and researchers has been advancing a sensorimotor perspective on autism for years; at last, the scientific community is beginning to catch up. Since the article''s initial publication in Disability Studies Quarterly, the sensorimotor hypothesis has garnered even more support (Donnellan et al., 2010). For example, a meta-analysis from 2010 concluded, “ASD is associated with significant and widespread alterations in motor performance” (Fournier et al., 2010). The article went so far as to propose that motor differences constitute a “core element” of autism and that “interventions aimed at improving … motor coordination (i.e., gait and balance, arm functions, and movement planning)” should be considered. A study from 2011 found that gross and fine motor differences in autistic children increased significantly with “each 6-month period of chronological age” (Lloyd et al., 2011). It recommended “addressing motor development in early intervention treatments.” And a study from 2012 reported that “motor skills were substantially impaired among ASD-affected children and highly correlated with autistic severity and IQ” (Hilton et al., 2012). By looking at the siblings of autistic children and finding in them no equivalent impairment, the study was able to directly link sensorimotor disturbances with ASD.

Savarese\r\n\r\nHumanities Writ Large Fellow, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA\r\n\r\nThis triad of clinicians and researchers has been advancing a sensorimotor perspective on autism for years; at last, the scientific community is beginning to catch up. Since the article''s initial publication in Disability Studies Quarterly, the sensorimotor hypothesis has garnered even more support (Donnellan et al., 2010). For example, a meta-analysis from 2010 concluded, “ASD is associated with significant and widespread alterations in motor performance” (Fournier et al., 2010). The article went so far as to propose that motor differences constitute a “core element” of autism and that “interventions aimed at improving … motor coordination (i.e., gait and balance, arm functions, and movement planning)” should be considered. A study from 2011 found that gross and fine motor differences in autistic children increased significantly with “each 6-month period of chronological age” (Lloyd et al., 2011). It recommended “addressing motor development in early intervention treatments.” And a study from 2012 reported that “motor skills were substantially impaired among ASD-affected children and highly correlated with autistic severity and IQ” (Hilton et al., 2012). By looking at the siblings of autistic children and finding in them no equivalent impairment, the study was able to directly link sensorimotor disturbances with ASD. It, too, contended that motor impairment is a “core characteristic” of autism and that treatment should reflect this fact. The tide has clearly shifted with respect to the sensorimotor hypothesis; what was once dismissed out of hand by an earlier generation of autism researchers is now increasingly being taken up for its superior explanatory power.\r\n\r\nRead more of <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Integrative_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnint.2013.00006/full">Moving the Field: The Sensorimotor Perspective on Autism</a> as it appears in <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/">frontiers</a>', 'Just Published: Moving the Field: The Sensorimotor Perspective on Autism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1066-revision-13', '', '', '2013-08-28 07:53:30', '2013-08-28 14:53:30', '', 1066, 'http://www.ralphsavarese.com/uncategorized/1066-revision-13/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

As he notes in another commentary, [3] part of which serves as the essay’s first epigraph, verisimilitude doesn’t interest him; rather, he paints to his senses, and the  senses in autism are often especially charged. With tremendous wit he links the “vivider dayglo colors” of the painting’s skies with the birds’ freedom to soar as they wish.
